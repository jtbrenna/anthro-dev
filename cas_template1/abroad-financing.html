<h3>Financing Study Abroad</h3>

<h4>Financial Aid</h4>
<p>If you participate in a UVM-approved study abroad program, you will be able to receive 
aid while abroad. However, UVM institutional-based financial aid no longer covers the 
costs of some programs. For more information contact the Financial Aid office and see 
<a href="www.uvm.edu/~oies/?Page=sa_cost.html">www.uvm.edu/~oies/?Page=sa_cost.html</a>. UVM institutional aid can usually be applied 
to bilateral exchange programs, ISEP, and UVM faculty-led programs. Many non-UVM programs offer scholarships.</p>

<h4>Funding</h4>
<p>There are several nationally competitive scholarships (including the Gilman, Boren, 
Critical Language Scholarship and Freeman in Asia Scholarship) that can provide 
funding to assist with the cost of study abroad, especially if you are studying a foreign 
language of strategic interest to the U.S., such as Arabic or Chinese. The Office of 
Fellowships Advising coordinates the university endorsement and application advising 
process for these scholarships. Students who have a strong academic record should 
arrange to meet with the Office of Fellowships Advising early in the study abroad 
planning process to get a sense of what prestigious scholarships may fit their interests and 
goals (802-656-4658, <a href="mailto:britten.chase@uvm.edu">britten.chase@uvm.edu</a>).</p>

<p>If you are interested in studying in Canada or Mexico, the Global and Regional Studies 
Program administers a grant that provides a $5,000 stipend to cover travel and living 
expenses if you participate in the UVM NAFTA Mobility Exchange Program (contact 
Luis Vivanco, <a href="mailto:lvivanco@uvm.edu">lvivanco@uvm.edu</a>).</p>

possibilities for students who plan to conduct independent research abroad or to attend a 
conference:</p>
