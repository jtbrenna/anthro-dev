<h3>Financial Assistance for Internships</h3>

<p>There are currently two funding sources that provide scholarship money for students who need financial assistance in order to accept an unpaid internship. These funding sources help make it more accessible for students to engage in unpaid or under-paid opportunities.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Anna Whitcomb Internship Scholarship</strong><br>
			The Anna Whitcomb Internship Scholarship is awarded to students who intend to participate in a career-related opportunity, and need financial assistance in order to accept an unpaid internship. Preference is given to internships that promote the common good and are mission-based/non-profit organizations. Preference is also given to undergraduate students. Applicants must be in good standing, and current students at the University of Vermont. Four awards of up to $2375 each will be awarded at the beginning of the summer. Applicants will be notified about the scholarship by April 18th.<br><br>
            Any degree-seeking University of Vermont student is eligible to apply. Eligible students must plan to continue their course of studies for the fall 2014 semester, which means that students planning to graduate in May 2014 are not eligible for this award. It is important to note that the purpose of this scholarship is to assist students with attaining experience relating to career and professional development. Because of this, scholarship decisions are not made on the basis of previous experience or GPA. Rather, awards are based on:
            <ul>
            	<li>The benefits a student will gain from the internship</li>
            	<li>How the internship aligns with a studentâ€™s career/professional goals</li>
            	<li>Financial need</li>
            </ul><br>
            <em>Do not rule yourself out!</em><br>
