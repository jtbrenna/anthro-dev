<p>Internship opportunities for <abbr>UVM</abbr> anthropology students are potentially even more diverse than faculty research collaboration opportunities, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li> internships through <abbr>UVM</abbr>, for example, work with the <abbr>UVM</abbr> Consulting Archaeology Program doing a gamut of field and/or laboratory activities</li>
  <li>internships external to <abbr>UVM</abbr> such as one student's recent work with the Vermont State Archaeologist, Vermont Division for Historic Preservation, in Montpelier</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other potential opportunities for internships, depending on the student's background and interest in anthropology, although these too are generally done by advanced students. </p>
<p><strong>How do you get involved? </strong>Students should <a href="/~anthro/?Page=faculty/faculty.php">contact individual faculty members</a> or talk to your advisor. <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~career/?Page=internships.html&amp;SM=otherjobsubmenu.html"><abbr>UVM</abbr>'s Career Center</a> also maintains a working knowledge of internships available outside of <abbr>UVM</abbr>.</p>
