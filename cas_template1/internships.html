<h3>Internships</h3>

    <p>Museum websites are a wonderful place to find internship opportunities. Nicole Bull (’15) interned at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in the summer of 2013.</p>

<p>Many of our students undertake internships abroad or in the U.S. with direct relevance to their Anthropology degrees—in not-for-profit organizations, businesses, government, media, and international organizations. Students can receive credit for the internship by going through a formal process and registering for internship credit, but even if you do not receive credit, internships offer excellent opportunities for gaining practical experience and networking opportunities. </p>

<p>Whether it is for credit or not, it is up to you to identify and apply for the specific internship you would like. The best way to identify an internship is to visit the Career Services office in person or <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~career/?Page=internships.html&SM=otherjobsubmenu.html">online</a> and examine their internship resources and learn about strategies for locating and creating internship opportunities, and speak with Anthropology faculty to find out what internships they would recommend. The Anthropology Department does not formally recommend any specific internship programs, but we are happy to advise you through the process and talk through different internship possibilities with you. You may also find a list of possible organizations:</p>

<p>If you plan to seek credit in Anthropology for the internship, you will need to identify a faculty member to supervise the academic aspects of the internship, ideally someone who has close research, teaching, or consulting ties to the type of organization to which you are applying. Together with that supervisor, you will decide the type of academic work that will accompany the internship, such as directed readings, producing a research paper, different kinds of writing such as journaling or reports, or any number of other outcomes.   There are also courses outside of Anthropology that offer credit for internship work, including EDSS 239 and CDAE 196.  All require that you arrange credit before starting the internship and all involve an academic component in addition to the internship hours.</p>

<h5>The following are helpful links for those thinking about internships:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h4 class="accordionButton">Can I take off from UVM and do an internship during one semester and have it count as credits in another semester when I am back on campus?</h4>
		<p class = "accordionContent">Technically not. Internship credits are available only for the semester in which you are doing the work. In order to receive credits, you need to be enrolled for internship credits at UVM. If you do take a semester of leave from UVM to do an internship, you could consider instead doing an independent study when you get back on campus, deepening your knowledge of themes you learned about while working as an intern.  Please contact the department chair to discuss options.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4 class="accordionButton">Are there any options for earning internship while in another city or country?</h4>
		<p class = "accordionContent">This may be difficult to arrange but it is sometimes possible depending on circumstances.  Contact Career Services and the department chair to learn more.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4 class="accordionButton">Can I get paid for an internship as well as earn credit?</h4>
		<p class = "accordionContent">Yes.  Earning credits for an internship is dependent upon registering (and paying) for those credits.  Whether the internship is paid is something you would discuss with the organization sponsoring your internship.  Some corporations prefer to pay interns in order to be in compliance with their interpretation of Bureau of Labor regulations.</p>
