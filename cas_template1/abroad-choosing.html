<h3>Choosing a Program</h3>

<h4>Location</h4>
<p>What region or country interests you most? Do you want a comparative/multi-country or 
stationary program? 
</p>

<h4>Program Type</h4>
<p>Do you want to go for an academic year? One semester? Summer? Winter break?</p>
<p>Do you want direct enrollment in a foreign university or to be in a group with other 
Americans? Do you want homestays or dormitory/independent residence? Do you want 
language immersion or English language? Do you want an anthropological field study 
component, or an ethnographic or archaeological field school? 
</p>
<p>Be aware that some programs are merely “American Bubbles” overseas and offer very 
little or no true cross-cultural immersion. Such programs offer very little for an 
anthropology education. We suggest that you seek out programs that offer sustained 
immersion in a culture different than your own.</p>

<h4>Credit Transfer</h4>
<p>Find out from the registrar’s office how the credits from the program you want to apply 
to transfer back to UVM: <a href="www.uvm.edu/~rgweb">www.uvm.edu/~rgweb</a></p>
