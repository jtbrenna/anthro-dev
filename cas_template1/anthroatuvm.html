    <p style="margin-bottom:6%;"><img src="images/perkins.jpg" height="130" width="132" alt="Professor George Henry Perkins" style="float:left; padding-right:10px;"/>Anthropology and <abbr>UVM</abbr> have roots going back to the early days of the discipline. One of the first, if not the first, undergraduate course in anthropology in the United States was taught here in 1886 by a geologist, and subsequent Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, George Henry Perkins. </p>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 12%;">Anthropology as a Four-Field Discipline</h4>

    <p>In the nineteenth century, Anthropology was organized into the four subfields we still know today—Socio-Cultural Anthropology, Archaeology, Physical/Biological Anthropology, and Linguistic Anthropology—because these once separate fields shared a common evolutionary perspective. In Europe and throughout the Global South, this holistic tradition gradually gave way to a specific focus on Socio-Cultural Anthropology. It is American anthropology that has strived to be the most holistic, a legacy championed by Franz Boas and his student Alfred Kroeber, who once described four-field anthropology as a “sacred bundle.” Over the decades, American anthropologists have fought hard to defend this four-field legacy, and as a result dozens of American universities have anthropology departments with each subfield represented, including UVM Anthropology.</p> 

    <p>Today, because of specialization, a small percentage of anthropologists actually work across the boundaries of subfields: one recent study observes that less than 10% of articles in the discipline’s flagship journal American Anthropologist combine subfields. Many respected anthropologists have also called for “unwrapping the sacred bundle.” Yet here at UVM, we continue to emphasize the value of a four-field education at the undergraduate level for a number of reasons:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It introduces students to the distinct areas of anthropological knowledge, which gives students an opportunity to follow a path that corresponds most closely to their interests.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialized research within the subfields benefits from a holistic grounding in the larger questions and concerns that interest the whole discipline.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, some cutting edge areas of research have emerged that cross subdisciplinary boundaries, such as biocultural research, ethnoarchaeology, etc.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students benefit from conversations faculty from different subfields have with each other about common and divergent perspectives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Departmental history</h4>
    <p>Anthropology at <abbr>UVM</abbr> became a separate department in 1971 and moved to its present location on the top floor of Williams Hall with its striking views of Lake Champlain and the Adirondacks. Today, we are one of the largest undergraduate-only anthropology departments in the nation.</p>

    <h4>Department of Anthropology Vision</h4>
    <p>The Anthropology Department at the University of Vermont strives to be a leading undergraduate four-field anthropology program excelling in research on the diversity of humans and their cultures, providing students with a high-quality comprehensive education in anthropology grounded in the liberal arts, and addressing pressing human problems shared over time and space.</p>

    <h4>Department of Anthropology Mission</h4>
    <p>The mission of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Vermont is to produce influential research in anthropology integrated with an outstanding undergraduate liberal arts education. Drawing on the interdisciplinary four-field tradition, we emphasize strong training in contemporary anthropological theory, research methods, and ethical practices, with the goal of preparing students to think critically and act as engaged citizens for the common good. Together as students and faculty, our scholarly community mobilizes anthropological knowledge to address questions of culture and its role in a diverse and changing world.</p>

    <h4>Committed, talented faculty</h4>
    <p>Although the faculty of the department is deeply committed to research and other scholarly activities, we see our primary mission as providing a first-rate undergraduate education. Many of our majors have gone on to graduate work in anthropology and have told us they appreciate the firm grounding in all four areas of the discipline they have received. </p>

    

    <h4>Variety of courses; hands-on advisement</h4>
    <p>We are especially committed to providing students with a comprehension of the variations in human populations and a sensitivity to cultural differences. In order to implement these concerns, we offer a variety of courses in all four subfields. Our advising program, including the Teacher Advisor Program (<acronym>TAP</acronym>) of first-year seminars, emphasizes individual attention and a mentoring relationship between faculty and students. </p>

    <p>Over the past ten years, the department offerings have become increasingly popular with <abbr>UVM</abbr> students. The department has added many new faculty who are contributing new perspectives and research initiatives. All of our faculty are actively engaged in scholarship, guaranteeing that our course offerings reflect developments and trends in contemporary Anthropology.</p>

    <h4>Internships, field work practicums, hands-on experience</h4>
    <p>Hands-on experience is integral to the study of anthropology. Field work and internships are available on a course or semester basis, typically for upper-level students.</p>

<p>We also have lab facilities where students interested in archaeology, human osteology, and forensic anthropology can find training and experience, including in class such as Human Osteology and Archaeology, Stone Tool Technologies and a yearly summer field school in archaeology. </p>

<p>Students may pursue their own interests by enrolling in Readings and Research in which they may work with an appropriate faculty member on their own individually-designed research. Highly motivated students may elect to do College Honors in which they prepare a major research project under the supervision of a faculty member.</p>
