<h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
<p>UVM takes academic integrity very seriously.  The University’s Code of Academic Integrity notes that “Standards of academic integrity are necessary for evaluating the quality of student work in a fair manner.” Violations of academic integrity include plagiarism, fabrication, collusion, and cheating. It is the student’s responsibility to know and adhere to this policy, which is found on the following webpage: <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/cses/code_ai.html">http://www.uvm.edu/cses/code_ai.html</a>.  Violations of the code have serious consequences.</p>
