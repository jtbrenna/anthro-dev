<h3>Undergraduate Programs</h3>
<div id="intro">
<p>Requirements for the major and minor in Anthropology changed in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Please be careful to <strong>follow the requirements for your entering class</strong>, and contact your advisor if you are unsure which requirements to follow.</p>

<h4>Major and minor offerings</h4>
<p>We strive to prepare students in four areas/sub-fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>archaeology</li>
  <li>biological anthropology</li>
  <li>sociocultural anthropology</li>
  <li>linguistic anthropology </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the major, we also offer a minor in anthropology. The minor emphasizes developing an understanding of at least two of the four subfields. We also feel a strong obligation to provide students who are not concentrating in anthropology with a sense of the discipline and especially some idea of the diversity of human kind. </p>
