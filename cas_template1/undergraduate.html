<h3>Undergraduate Program in Anthropology</h3>

    <p>The department offers a broad range of courses reflecting the breadth of the discipline as well as the diversity of our faculty's experiences and research interests. </p>

    <p><strong>Our program begins with four basic courses designed to introduce anthropology's four major subfields:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cultural Anthropology</li>
      <li>Prehistoric Archaeology</li>
      <li>Biological Anthropology</li>
      <li>Linguistic Anthropology</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Students can gain practical field experience in courses such as:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Field Work in Archaeology</li>
      <li>Methods of Ethnographic Field Work</li>
      <li>Human Osteology and Archaeology</li>
      <li>Laboratory Archaeology</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Course offerings emphasize cultures of different areas of the world with particular strengths in:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Latin America and the Caribbean</li>
      <li>North America</li>
      <li>China</li>
      <li>Eastern Europe</li>
      <li>Africa</li>
      <li>South Asia</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Faculty also regularly teach topical classes related to their ongoing research. Recent offerings include:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Food and Culture</li>
      <li>Anthropology of Media</li>
      <li>Culture, Health and Healing</li>
      <li>Primates and Anthropology</li>
      <li>Street Children</li>
      <li>Bioarchaeology of Identities</li>
      <li>Language, Gender and Sexuality</li>
      <li>Archaeology of the American Southwest</li>
      <li>Language and Mind</li>
      <li>Landscape Anthropology and Spatial Analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to the major, we offer a minor in anthropology. The minor emphasizes developing an understanding of at least two of the four subfields. We also feel a strong obligation to provide students who are not concentrating in anthropology with a sense of the discipline and especially some idea of the diversity of human kind.</p>
