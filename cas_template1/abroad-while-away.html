<h3>While You Are Abroad</h3>

<h4>Journal</h4>
<p>You are likely to experience some culture shock, even if you study in a country with 
strong cultural similarities to the U.S., like England or Australia. We strongly 
recommend that you keep a journal in which you can work through the processes of 
cultural adjustment, reflecting on the ups and downs of your experience. It is standard 
practice among anthropologists to keep a field journal.</p>

<h4>Planning for Future Work</h4>
<p>A study abroad location and experience can provide the basis for a senior thesis, 
future work independent study, or term paper after you return. If you need help thinking through 
possible topics to pursue when you get back, or help identifying materials and 
information to collect while you are there, talk with your programâ€™s academic leaders and 
contact your advisor back here at UVM.</p>

<h4>Save Everything!</h4>
<p>Bring <u>all</u> your syllabi, copies of papers, and other documentation back with you to ensure smooth transfer of credit.</p>
