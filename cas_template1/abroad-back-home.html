<h3>Bringing the Experience Back Home</h3>

<h4>Adjustment</h4>
<p>Coming back home can be just as challenging as going. You will have changed in 
relation to your own culture, and wonder where you fit in back here. You will probably 
also miss your lifestyle and friends from abroad. There are several keys to settling back 
into life here:</p>

<ul>
<li><u>Share your experience with others</u>: Attend an OIE study abroad returnees’ gathering; 
become an OIE study abroad peer advisor; organize a round table discussion with other 
students to discuss your experience; hold a slide show for friends; do a photo or object 
exhibit in the anthro department display cases.</li><br>
<li><u>Use your new skills</u>: Keep your language skills up by seeking out others who speak the 
language; hone your cross-cultural communication skills by tutoring an international 
student or volunteering in town with groups you might not normally get involved with 
(immigrants, community outreach, etc.) 
</li><br>
<li><u>Don’t assume that you are the only one who has changed</u>: Friends and family will have 
experienced new things and changed while you were away too. Don’t assume you’re the 
only one with good stories and be a good listener. 
</li><br>
<li><u>Keep learning about the places you went</u>: Take more coursework that focuses on places 
and issues you encountered abroad, and try to use course writing assignments to deepen 
your knowledge of these themes.
