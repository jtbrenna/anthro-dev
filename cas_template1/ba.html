<h3>Bachelor of Arts (<abbr>B.A.</abbr>) in Anthropology</h3>

<div id="intro">
<h4>How should I plan out my major?</h4>
<p>All students majoring in Anthropology should carefully consult the major worksheet:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~anthro/documents/anth_major_worksheet_11_08_13.docx">Downloadable major planning worksheet</a></p>
<p>The Anthropology Department strongly recommends taking all four introductory classes as early as possible in your major, preferably by the end of the first semester of your junior year, or within a year of declaring your anthropology major. Completing the introductory courses will allow you to move on to upper-level courses in any of the subfields, to complete your two-subfield 100-level requirement in any of the subfields you choose, and to focus on “customizing” your major by taking classes that interest you the most.</p>
<p>Depending on how many anthropology classes you take per semester, you may be able to begin taking 100-level courses while completing the introductory sequence, and you should complete two 100-level classes in Anthropology and achieve junior standing before taking 200-level courses.</p>
