<h5><strong>James B. Petersen Archaeology Award</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The James B. Petersen Award is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Jim Petersen (1954-2005).&nbsp; Jim received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Anthropology and Environmental Studies from the University of Vermont in 1979, and a Ph.D. in Anthropology from the University of Pittsburgh in 1983.&nbsp; After several years as director of the Archaeological Research Facility at the University of Maine at Farmington, Jim returned to the University of Vermont in 1997 where he was an Associate Professor and Chair of the Anthropology Department.&nbsp; He was promoted to Professor posthumously.&nbsp; Jim&rsquo;s areas of interest were vast, and his research centered on the archaeology of Eastern North America, the Caribbean, and the Brazilian Amazon.&nbsp; This research generated numerous publications on such topics as cultural interaction, style and ethnicity, hunter-gatherer/horticultural adaptations, the origins of socio-political complexity, and ceramic and fiber perishable  technologies.&nbsp; Courses he taught while at UVM include Prehistoric Archaeology, Historic Archaeology, Archaeological Theory, Field Work in Archaeology, Hunter-Gatherer Cultures, Native Cultures of South America, Peoples and Cultures of the Caribbean, Native Cultures of Vermont, and Native Cultures of North America.&nbsp; More than anything, Jim will be remembered for his generosity and absolute love of archaeology; he lived and breathed it.&nbsp; In this spirit, this award goes to graduating seniors who share in this respect and passion for the field of archaeology.</em></p>
