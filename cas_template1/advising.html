<h3>About Advising</h3>
<h4>What does an advisor do?</h4>
<p>Think of an  advisor as your academic liaison. An advisor is meant to be an approachable faculty member, one who is also skilled in your chosen area of expertise, and who can enhance the student's relationship with the university.</p>
<p>Registration at <abbr>UVM</abbr> is done electronically, but advisors can be helpful in selecting courses, as well as explaining the organization and policies of the College and ensuring that you have fulfilled all the requirements you need to graduate.</p>

<h5>Advising - Minor</h5>
<p>Any student who decides to minor in anthropology can choose one of the minor advisors (currently Professors Mares and VanValkenburgh) as their advisor. They will let the  department's administrative assistant know and she will, in turn, assign the advisor formally.</p>

<h4>What is a CATS Audit and how do I do it?</h4>
<p>CATS (Curriculum Audit Tracking System) is UVM's degree audit system that produces automated, individualized reports to help students track their progress toward completing their degrees. The CATS audit, used by students and advisors, identifies both completed and outstanding requirements and provides a current list of courses that can be taken to satisfy them. For a description of how to run a report go here:<br>
