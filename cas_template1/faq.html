<h3>Frequently Asked Questions - Advising</h3>

<h4 class="accordionButton">Who is my advisor?</h4>

<p class = "accordionContent">You can find out by going to the Registrar's Homepage and clicking on Banner for Students. You can also come by the department office (509 Williams Hall), email (anthro@uvm.edu) or call (656-3884), and ask the department administrative assistant for that information. If you have been working with or have specific interests that align with a particular faculty member, you can ask the administrative assistant to assign you to that person as your advisor. If for whatever reason you need to change advisors, you can also ask the administrative assistant to help you.</p>

<p class = "accordionContent">While every effort is made to continue your advisor assignment from the moment you declare your major, it isn't always possible because of changes in faculty assignments (e.g. sabbatical leaves), changing program enrollments, and students changing from one program to another. So there are times when students must be reassigned. If you are reassigned to a new advisor, keep in mind that this can be a great opportunity to get to know another Anthropology faculty member.</p>

<h4 class="accordionButton">What is the best way to get in touch with my academic advisor?</h4>

<p class = "accordionContent">At the beginning of each semester, your advisor should send you a note indicating when s/he has office hours, or indicating a willingness to schedule appointments. Office hour times and contact information for all faculty can also be found <a href="Page=faculty.html&SM=facultysubmenu.html">here</a>. If you have a conflict in your schedule that prevents you from attending office hours, you should send an e-mail to your advisor and ask the best way to schedule an appointment.</p>

<p class = "accordionContent">Many students contact their faculty advisor by e-mail. If you do so, we ask you to be clear about your questions/issues and, if the issue is quite complex, your advisor will ask you to schedule an appointment.</p>

<h4 class="accordionButton">What is a CATS Audit and how do I do it?</h4>

<p class = "accordionContent">CATS (Curriculum Audit Tracking System) is UVM's degree audit system that produces automated, individualized reports to help students track their progress toward completing their degrees. The CATS Audit, used by students and advisors, identifies both completed and outstanding requirements and provides a current list of courses that can be taken to satisfy them. For a description of how to run a report, go <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~rgweb/?Page=registration/r_CATSreports.html">here</a>.</p>

<h4 class="accordionButton">Do I have to take all the intro courses first?</h4>
 
<p class = "accordionContent">You do not need to take all required introductory classes before taking 100-level classes. However, we strongly recommend that you complete the introductory classes by the end of the first semester of your junior year.   Doing so will allow you to take advantage of the upper-level courses that interest you the most and give you the strong foundation that will allow you to do your best in those advanced courses.  In addition, few seniors enjoy taking introductory level lecture courses during their final year in college.</p>
 
<h4 class="accordionButton">Should I take a theory class?</h4>
 
<p class = "accordionContent">Most 200-level courses cover theoretical material in a particular area of anthropology. If you think you may want to attend graduate school, a course specifically on theory (Anth 210 or Anth 225) is strongly recommended, as well as a methods course related to your chosen subfield (such as ANTH 200; 240; 245; 250; 284; 290).</p>
 
<h4 class="accordionButton">What minors are good choices for an Anthropology major?</h4>
 
<p class = "accordionContent">Any and all minors are compatible with an Anthropology major, so if you are interested in a particular minor, you should pursue it.  Depending on your interests, there are a number of minors that are popular choices to pair with an anthropology major, including a minor in a language or in Linguistics; in an area studies program or Global Studies; a minor in another social science (Sociology, Geography, Political Science, Economics, Psychology); a cross-college minor such as Business; Community and International Development (CDAE); GeoSpatial Technologies (NR); or one of the sciences (e.g., Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry). Some students with interests not represented as a minor, such as in the subfield of medical anthropology or global health opt to design their own minor (<a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~idmcas/">IDM</a>), a process which requires an application and approval before the majority of the courses are taken. <br><br>If you would like to pursue a cross-college minor, you should contact the minor advisor for that program as early as possible to ensure that you are able to complete all of the minor requirements. Note that the Anthropology minor is NOT open to Anthropology majors. Many of our students decide to double major instead of or in addition to completing a minor (see below).</p>
 
<h4 class="accordionButton">I am thinking of double-majoring. What should I know?</h4>
 
<p class = "accordionContent">Double majors are not required to complete a minor, however, they must complete requirements for both majors, and can count only one course toward both majors (see “double dipping” below).  Double majoring allows you all of the advantages of in-depth study in two different major fields.  However, completing all of the requirements for both majors will limit the number of elective courses you can take in other departments. Fulfilling all of the requirements for two majors may make study abroad a bit more complicated, so you will need to plan ahead. <br><br>Anthropology is a good complement to many other majors, and our students have often found creative ways to create connections between Anthropology and other majors as diverse as Theater, Classics, Biology, History, English and Psychology. If you choose to double-major, you should make sure to keep in touch with your major advisor in each department and plan to make steady progress on both sets of major requirements each semester. It is also possible to major in Anthropology and double-minor in two other fields of study or any other such combinations.</p>

<h4 class="accordionButton">What is the “double-dipping rule” and how would it affect me?</h4>
 
<p class = "accordionContent">Students are allowed to count only one course toward both their major and minor, or both majors in a double major. The reason for this is to ensure that students can’t receive two degrees with half the work by choosing overlapping courses that count toward both.  Students majoring in Anthropology and minoring or double-majoring in an interdisciplinary program such as Global and Regional Studies or Linguistics should be careful not to count more than one class towards the required coursework for both.  If you have questions about planning out a double major or major/minor pairing, your advisor can help you.</p>
 
<h4 class="accordionButton">Can I take more than one 095/096, 195/196 or 295/296 course and have it count toward my major?</h4>
 
<p class = "accordionContent">Each semester, faculty in Anthropology offer Special Topics courses at different levels, introductory (095 or 096); intermediate (195 or 196) and advanced (295 or296). In addition, Linguistic Anthropology special topics courses are offered as 176 and 276. You can take more than one special topics class (in the same semester, or across semesters) as long as the classes have different titles and topics. Courses labeled 195/6, 295/6, 176 or 276 can count toward your major in the same way that any other 100- or 200- level course would.</p>

<h4 class="accordionButton">Is Anth 164 harder than Anth 184?</h4>

<p class = "accordionContent">No. There is no meaning to the order of the courses within each sequence (00-levels, 100-levels, 200-levels), just between the sequences. Your best guide here it to consult the prerequisites for each course to see what students are expected to know when beginning each course.</p>
 
<h4 class="accordionButton">Can I do an internship?</h4>
 
<p class = "accordionContent">Yes. See the link under Student Opportunities for more information.</p>
