<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<h4 class="accordionButton">Do I have to take all the intro courses first?</h4>
 
<p class = "accordionContent">You do not need to take all four introductory classes before taking 100-level classes.  However, we strongly recommend that you complete all four introductory classes by the end of the first semester of your junior year.   Doing so will allow you to take advantage of the upper-level courses that interest you the most and give you the strong foundation that will allow you to do your best in those advanced courses.  In addition, few seniors enjoy taking introductory level lecture courses during their final year in college.</p>
 
<h4 class="accordionButton">Should I take a theory class?</h4>
 
<p class = "accordionContent">For students entering the university in 2007 or later, an upper level theory course is not required.  Most 200-level courses cover theoretical material in a particular area of anthropology.  If you think you may want to attend graduate school, a course specifically on theory (Anth 210 or Anth 225) is strongly recommended, as well as a methods course related to your chosen subfield (such as ANTH 200; 240;245;250; 284; 290).</p>
 
<h4 class="accordionButton">What minors are good choices for an Anthropology major?</h4>
 
<p class = "accordionContent">Any and all minors are compatible with an Anthropology major, so if you are interested in a particular minor, you should pursue it.  Depending on your interests, there are a number of minors that are popular choices to pair with an anthropology major, including a minor in a language or in Linguistics; in an area studies program or Global Studies; a minor in another social science (Sociology, Geography, Political Science, Economics, Psychology); a cross-college minor such as Business; Community and International Development (CDAE) or GeoSpatial Technologies (NR).  While it is not a minor per say, it is also worth mentioning that many students interested in the subfield of Medical Anthropology or Global Health opt to combine their studies in Anthropology with a suite of Pre-Med or Pre-Health courses. <br><br>If you would like to pursue a cross-college minor, you should contact the minor advisor for that program as early as possible to ensure that you are able to complete all of the minor requirements.  Note that the Anthropology minor is NOT open to Anthropology majors.</p>
 
<h4 class="accordionButton">I am thinking of double-majoring. What should I know?</h4>
 
<p class = "accordionContent">Double majors are not required to complete a minor, however they must complete all of the requirements for both majors, and can count only one course towards both majors (see “double dipping” below).  Double majoring allows you all of the advantages of in-depth study in two different major fields.  However, completing all of the requirements for both majors will limit the number of elective courses you can take in other departments.  Fulfilling all of the requirements for two majors may also make it difficult for you to study abroad. <br><br>Anthropology is a good complement to many other majors, and our students have often found creative ways to create connections between Anthropology and other majors as diverse as Theater, Classics, English and Psychology.  If you choose to double-major, you should make sure to keep in touch with your major advisor in each department and plan to make steady progress on both sets of major requirements each semester.  It is also possible to major in Anthropology and double-minor in two other fields of study.</p>
 
<h4 class="accordionButton">Can I take more than one 095/096, 195/196 or 295/296 course and have it count toward my major?</h4>
 
<p class = "accordionContent">Each semester, faculty in Anthropology offer Special Topics courses at different levels, introductory (095 or 096); intermediate (195 or 196) and advanced (295/296).  In addition, Linguistic Anthropology special topics courses are offered as 176 and 276.  You can take more than one special topics class (in the same semester, or across semesters) as long as the classes have different titles and topics.  Courses labeled 195/6, 295/6, 176 or 276 can count towards your major in the same way that any other 100 or 200 level course would.</p>
 
<h4 class="accordionButton">What is the “double-dipping rule” and how would it affect me?</h4>
 
<p class = "accordionContent">Students are allowed to count only one course toward both their major and minor, or both majors in a double major. The reason for this is to ensure that students can’t receive two degrees with half the work by choosing overlapping courses that count toward both.  Students majoring in Anthropology and minoring or double-majoring in an interdisciplinary program such as Global and Regional Studies or Linguistics should be careful not to count more than one class towards the required coursework for both.  If you have questions about planning out a double major or major/minor pairing, your advisor can help you.</p>
 
<!-- <h4 class="accordionButton">Can I do an internship?</h4>
 
<p class = "accordionContent">Yes. Many of our students undertake internships abroad or in the U.S. with direct relevance to their Anthropology degrees—in not-for-profit organizations, businesses, government, media, or international organizations. Students can receive credit for the internship by going through a formal process and registering for internship credit, but even if you do not receive credit, internships offer excellent opportunities for gaining practical experience and networking opportunities. <br><br>Whether it is for credit or not, it is up to you to identify and apply for the specific internship you would like. The best way to identify an internship is to visit the Career Services office in person or online (http://www.uvm.edu/~career/) and examine their internship resources and learn about strategies for locating and creating internship opportunities, and speak with Anthropology faculty to find out what internships they would recommend.  The Anthropology Department does not formally recommend any specific internship programs, but we are happy to advise you through the process and talk through different internship possibilities with you. <br><br>If you plan to seek credit in Anthropology for the internship, you will need to identify a faculty member to supervise the academic aspects of the internship, ideally someone who has close research, teaching, or consulting ties to the type of organization to which you are applying. Together with that supervisor, you will decide the type of academic work that will accompany the internship, such as directed readings, producing a research paper, different kinds of writing such as journaling or reports, or any number of other outcomes.   There are also courses outside of Anthropology that offer credit for internship work, including EDSS 239 and CDAE 196.  All require that you arrange credit before starting the internship and all involve an academic component in addition to the internship hours.</p> -->
