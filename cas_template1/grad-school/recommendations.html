<h3>What Should I Know About Recommendation Letters?</h3>

<p>These are also <strong>extremely important</strong>, so be sure that these people know you and particularly your work and abilities.</p>

<p>A key problem for an admissions committee is how to evaluate students coming from different academic and social contexts, so they tend to rely on recommendations from colleagues to get a sense of the applicant’s abilities. This means that if your recommender knows someone at the school to which you are applying, or your recommender’s work is more widely known outside of your department, then the admissions committee will be able to contextualize your application better. You do need to be aware of these dynamics (some might call it an ‘old boy’s network,’ although this term is inaccurate because academia is not so exclusive nor are anthropology departments necessarily dominated by men), since the applications process is only the beginning of having to deal with this and it will be there constantly throughout (at least the early years of) your career. After all, academia is a social network! This is not to say that you won’t get accepted at a place where no one knows who your recommenders are; but you could certainly use this knowledge to your advantage and apply to those places where there may be previous relations between them and a recommender or two (or even if a student from your department has gone there and done well). Having some kind of benchmark on which they can rely enhances your possibilities immensely.  But don’t let this scare you from applying at places even where you feel like it could be a longshot - you never know!</p>

<p>If you have taken time off after your BA, it is acceptable to use the recommendation of an employer who knows you well. However, <em>at least two out of your likely three</em> recommenders should know you from an academic context.</p>

<p><em>When you ask for any recommendation from a professor or employer, ask well in advance of the deadline (especially professors, who are swamped with writing recs when you want yours) and send them an updated resume/CV so they know you better as a whole person. Be sure to tell the recommender what you want him or her to include in the letter (i.e., skills, experiences, service, internship, TA experience, etc). And consider asking them for feedback on your personal statement.</em></p>
