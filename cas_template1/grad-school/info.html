<p><a href="http://www.aaanet.org/">American Anthropological Association</a>
	<br>The definitive source for links to websites treating all the subdisciplines of anthropology, including socio-cultural, archaeological, biophysical, linguistic and applied. They have constantly updated links to different websites of anthropological interest. You should especially check out their career pages, where they list available jobs, as well as the essential <em>American Anthropological Association Guide to Departments</em>, an annually published tome that lists faculty and basic information on all departments. We have one in the department office. Extremely helpful for finding out who is in what departments and what they work on. You can also find the <em>American Anthropological Association Newsletter</em> to get a sense of the state of the discipline, the job market, funding opportunities, etc. Most faculty receive this and it is on-line through the AAA website.</p>
