<h3>When Should I be Completing the Steps Toward Graduate School Application?</h3>

<p><em>A Basic Timeline</em></p>

<p>The following timeline will help you think about when you should be doing things, if you are applying for fall entry. If you're applying to a school with rolling entry (uncommon), adjust this schedule accordingly.</p>

<p>The year before you want to enter:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Spring/Summer</em>: <br> Study for and take GRE; send for catalogues, applications and identify desirable departments; send letters to faculty that you might be interested in working with; let recommenders know so if they want they can begin to write recommendations; request info on national competitions for grad funding such as NSF, Javits, etc.</li>
	<li><em>Early Fall</em>: <br> Take GRE again (if necessary); definitely secure recommendations from advisors; write and circulate personal statement; visit schools and talk with students; prepare c.v. and materials to include with application.</li>
	<li><em>Late Fall</em>: <br> Fill out and mail in applications; apply for national competitions such as NSF, Javits, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Year you enter:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Early Winter</em>: <br> Finish sending applications.</li>
	<li><em>Late Winter/Spring</em>: <br> Wait to hear from schools... and then wait some more...</li>
	<li><em>Late Spring/Early Summer</em>: <br> If you're accepted, make a visit and weigh offers (see What if I am accepted?); set up financial aid and loans</li>
</ul>
