<h3>What About the GRE (Graduate Record Examinations)?</h3>

<p>The GRE is required for most graduate programs in the US, but is it important? Sort of. It hurts your chances for admission <strong>only if your score is low</strong>. It helps the admissions committee make a quick first cut. In some schools, they are more likely to give funding if your score is high.</p>

<p>There is no special exam for Anthropology (although there is for other fields such as Sociology).</p>

<p><em>Key</em>: This seems to be the most intimidating aspect of the graduate admissions process, but it shouldn’t be.  Prepare for it, by either taking a course (expensive) or buying a book that includes some practice exams (cheap). Learn the tricks of how to take it and do well (prove to everyone how easy it is to circumvent the actual content of the test, and by implication, what a useless and biased test it is!).  Many people take it twice, and improve markedly the second time.</p>

<p>Take the GRE before or just after you leave UVM. It is much easier to prepare for standardized tests in this setting than when you are working full-time in an unrelated field!</p>

<p><strong>Be aware!</strong> Cultural anthro departments generally only care about the analytical and verbal scores, but that doesn’t mean you should sleep through the math.</p>

<p><em>If you demonstrate clarity of purpose, maturity and panache in your personal statement and have persuasive recommendations, grades, GRE scores, and so on should not really matter too much for admissions decisions (although they may for funding).</em></p>
