<h3>Should I take time between UVM and grad school?</h3>

<p>Ask yourself: Will I be burnt-out by my second or third year?</p>
<p><em>If yes, wait</em>. Also, admissions committees are looking for maturity (not always what they award you a B.A. for), so <strong>time off will likely enhance your application</strong>, especially if you do work/travel in a related field/venue (In fact, the average age of Ph.D. recipients in Anthropology is 39!). Besides the usual (job, travel) you might consider using your time between undergrad and grad to <strong>further your research goals...</strong></p>

<p>...apply for a Fullbright grant, a Watson, attend a field school, work on language skills, or find work as a research assistant on a project (this will probably be easiest for archaeologically-bound folks), etc. The UVM Office of Fellowship Advising will have information on grants and programs. Even if you plan to work full time in an unrelated field, spend at least some time on an internship or unpaid research assistantship that keeps you close to Anthropology.</p>

<p><em>These considerations will affect where you apply, on what you chose to work, with whom you will work and, most importantly, it will help orient you throughout the entire process.  Before proceeding, you will have to make some very sobering assessments and decisions, so it is important to carefully consider why you want to go to grad school.</em></p>
