<h3>What If I Have Been Accepted?</h3>

<p><strong>Funding</strong>: Now, the question is, how am I going to pay for this?! If you were lucky, you got a fellowship offer. If you have multiple fellowship offers, you can use them as bargaining chips to get a slightly higher stipend or benefits. Be modest and humble - don’t push these things - but if a school is serious about you, they may see what they can do so they don’t lose you to one that gives you a better offer.</p>

<p>If you are going to be paying with loans (Staffords, Nellie Mae, etc.), you need to think about applying for them the spring/summer before you enter.  The financial aid office will help with this.</p>

<p><strong>Don't expect a deferment</strong> unless you worked it out with the school ahead of time, especially if they have offered you a fellowship.  Fellowship monies are limited, and can disappear if no one takes it, so departments are nervous if accepted students don't come. Most will not even guarantee that you will be accepted next year, since the next crop of applicants could be stronger. If you need to ask, do though.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to prepare for entering your first year of grad school?</strong><br>
<strong>Rest!</strong> Don’t feel like you have to read all sorts of stuff to prepare yourself - unless you’re normally like this you’ll probably just exhaust y ourself, and the first year of grad school is intense enough as it is (in terms of the quantity and quality of work expected), that it probably won't do you any particular good... (This is open to debate, though. For example, some might argue that a reading group with friends or colleagues would be helpful...)
