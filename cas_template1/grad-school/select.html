<h3>How Do I Select a Program/School?</h3>

<p><em>Ask your professors.</em></p>
<p>Your professors will know which programs are hot right now, which are strong in specific subfields, which have advisors who might be open to working with you, and which have funding you might be competitive for. Just as in college admissions, your professors will also have a sense of which schools are realistic for you and which might be a reach/safety.</p>

<p><em>Check the departmental websites and the course schedules.</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>What special programs and foci do they offer?</li>
	<li>How often do they offer the courses you want?</li>
	<li>Will you be taking a lot of independent study courses if the course offerings are light or not in your areas of interest?</li>
	<li>Are there people in the department or other departments who would actually do these things with you?</li>
	<li>Can you take courses at other universities in the same city? (...one of the bonuses of NYC area).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Paying a Visit?</em></p>
<p>Like with the Great College Tour, if you can afford it, visiting ahead of time can be helpful in making decisions. Find out when is a good time to go (Summer is always bad, Spring tends to be busy. Try early Fall, before all the application deadlines, and when people are not yet working very hard.) Arrange to meet with students and selected faculty, maybe even sit in on a class or a department-wide talk. Keep in mind that these people will be quite busy, but they should take you seriously since you are a potential colleague. If you can’t actually visit, call or write to a faculty member or two announcing your interests and ask about the program. Your questions should not be questions that are available in the department’s web resources (this annoys potential advisors to no end). Also, you could get in touch with a grad student from a program and ask him or her for details. You could visit schools after getting accepted at them (sometimes they’ll pay or provide you with room and board), when you have a more concrete sense of the possibilities (and you won’t get your hopes up that a particular school will accept you).</p>

<p><em>Selection Criteria Number One: the Faculty.</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Who is there?</li>
	<li>Who do you want to work with?  (Identify at least two or three)</li>
	<li>Will the professor(s) you want to work with be on sabbatical during your coursework?</li>
	<li>What are <em>professor-professor relations</em> like?</li>
	<li>Are they at each other’s throats, or do they get along?</li>
	<li>Do students get in the middle of acrimonious squabbles? What are <em>professor-student relations</em> like?</li>
	<li>Do they cultivate mentoring relationships, or do you work more with a committee?</li>
	<li>There are important trade-offs to consider with each of these models:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Mentors can bring access to resources</em>, research projects, etc...but they can also be tyrants.</li>
		<li><em>Committees often allow more independent work</em>...but sometimes they don't take care of you like a mentor might. Do faculty include students in department-level politics and activities? Are the faculty formal, or informal with their students?</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Do they leave grad students to figure things out by themselves, including actual work, bureaucratic maneuvers, and practical career training, or do they supportively walk you through these things? (It will most likely tend toward the former, especially at universities where undergraduate teaching or faculty research is the primary mission or faculty are more concerned with their research.)</li>
	<li>How are M.A. students treated (as opposed to Ph.D. students or undergrads)?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>You should identify up to <strong>two or three</strong> faculty with whom you would like to work, and you should consider contacting them ahead of time and let them know who you are. If they are enthusiastic about you, this could enhance your application.</em></p>

<p><em>Other Issues to Consider</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Does the department have a general approach, style or regional concentration?</li>
	<li>For example, in Cultural Anthropology, Princeton is known for its interpretive approach, Chicago for its work on the structural aspects of culture, Cornell for Asian Studies, etc. This might ultimately shape what kind of Anthropology you do, and the networks in which you find yourself.</li>
	<li>Do you want preparation in all four fields, and does the department offer/require it? (Less and less common)</li>
	<li>What are relations like with other departments in the university? Do Anthro folks get involved with other departments and programs? Which ones? Do students actually do fieldwork? Where?</li>
	<li>How long do students take to finish? What are their stumbling blocks?</li>
	<li>Is there an exchange program with other grad schools (in the U.S. and abroad)? (This could make a difference if there are several people at different universities with whom you could see yourself working.)</li>
	<li>What are the graduate students enthusiastic about? (All grad students are cynical, but you can usually tell if their gripes are major ones.)</li>
	<li>Are there differences in the ways that M.A. students and Ph.D. students are treated by the department or university? (i.e., access to funding, teaching, resources, etc.)</li>
	<li>Could you spend anywhere from the next two to nine years of your life in that town or city?  Is there intellectual or social life beyond the university?</li>
	<li>Do you want to move away for a Ph.D.? If you do not want to (or cannot) actually move away to do a Ph.D., consider distance-learning options, such as the Union Institute, etc. However, the good ones are few and far between and require <em>incredible</em> independence.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the increasing application fees, it isn’t cheap to get the ‘privilege’ to be considered for acceptance. Therefore, you should reconcile your pocketbook with the number of schools you’re applying to. <em>Nevertheless, it is usually better to throw a wider net than a more narrow one (i.e., <strong>anywhere between 5 and 10 schools</strong> instead of just one or two), even if it is expensive. It’s an investment in the future</em>.</p>
