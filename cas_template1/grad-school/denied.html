<h3>What If I Am Not Accepted to Any of the Schools to Which I Applied?</h3>
<br>
<p>First off, please try not to feel so bad. You can never know for certainty why a school did or did not accept you - there are many dynamics internal to departments that you can't know from the outside. Nevertheless, you should try to find out what eliminated you as a candidate, and see if you can correct it before applying next year (by taking more college level courses, retaking the GRE, getting relevant work experience, or rewriting a personal statement, etc.). Or, you could apply in a different discipline, or for an M.A. instead of a Ph.D.</p>
