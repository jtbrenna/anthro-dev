<h3>What Should I Know About the Application?</h3>

<p><em>Statement of Purpose/Intent</em></p>
<p>This is hands-down <strong>the most significant component of your application</strong>, so it has to be well-written and polished. Begin with a clear and forceful opening; remember that the admissions committee is seeing hundreds of these, and yours has to stand out. It could be a motivating question (it should not be rhetorical), a perplexing situation or contradiction (that you then explain), or an outright statement or observation - but it should convey a sense that it’s not only important to you, but that it has wider relevance (otherwise it sounds narcissistic).</p>

<p><em>In the body of the statement you should explain the following: </em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Why you? </li>
	<li>What have you done to prepare yourself to do well?</li>
	<li>What themes and region do you want to work on? (corollary: Who do you want to work with? Be specific and name names, THEREBY CUSTOMIZING EACH ESSAY FOR EACH SCHOOL TO WHICH YOU APPLY)</li>
	<li>What are your goals/plans with this?</li>
</ul>

<p>A good way to organize your essay would be to devote <strong>one paragraph to answering each of these questions</strong>.</p>

<p>As you are communicating your desire to go onto graduate study, be aware that admissions committee people tend to like those people who they see as eager to take on the vagaries of graduate school itself, as well as it being an important part of their career plan; therefore you probably don’t need to spend more than a sentence or two on your final career goals unless that is a specific essay question. Also, style counts: try not to plug in the answers to these questions mechanically, since they should organically meld into one another. Wrap up the essay by referring back to your opening observations, question, etc, making the whole a tight package. Be sure to circulate this essay among recommenders, faculty, friends, etc. ahead of time to work out all the kinks.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT POINT: While this is called a “personal statement” it is really a “professional statement” not an exercise in creative writing (as I walked out of my adobe hut and saw the sunset framing the children playing in the mud, I knew from in the depths of my heart that I was destined to be an anthropologist). You are likely to annoy your readers if you write something that might be suitable for an undergraduate admissions essay. Also, no one cares if you’ve wanted to be an archaeologist and dug up your backyard with a spoon when you were six. You want to establish yourself as mature and sophisticated, yet humble.</p>

<p><em>In identifying your areas of interest, be as specific as possible. Although you won’t be held to them since everybody's interests and projects evolve, you show them that you have a wider sense of where you are going in the field and life. A good committee will be looking for a delicate balance between a solid sense of direction and an open cast of mind.</em></p>

<p><em>Miscellanea</em></p>
<p>Along with your application send a copy of a <strong>particularly good</strong> paper you wrote (thesis or independent study), or publications, to give the admissions committee an idea about your actual work and abilities.</p>

<p>Make sure you list any honors, presentations, conference participations, and foreign experience.  This is the kind of stuff that could be offered on a <strong>C.V. that you include with your application</strong>.</p>
