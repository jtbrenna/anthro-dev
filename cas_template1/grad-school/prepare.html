<h3>How Can I Best Prepare Myself Academically for Graduate School?</h3>

<p><em>Or, what to do before you graduate...</em></p>
<p>Get to know three (or at least two) professors pretty well - they will write your recommendations for you. Try to discuss this with the professors before you leave campus if you think there’s <em>any</em> chance of going onto grad school (even if it may not be Anthropology). Keep papers <em>with their comments</em>, so you can show them to your recommenders down the road to remind them of your work (and what they thought of it). Good recommendation letter provide specific details about candidates.</p>

<p><em>Courses in your major</em></p>
<p>What if you didn't major in the field you want to study in grad school? Don't let this discourage you from applying, since grad programs are always looking for people with interesting backgrounds. If you didn't major in the field, you may have to work harder in courses your first year than people who may have a background in the field. No matter what you major in though, you should have high grades in your major field - this shows them that you are a serious student when it comes to something that interests you</p>

<p><em>Do a Thesis or Independent Study, and/or a Field School</em></p>
<p>Not only will this help you decide if you have the gumption and interest to handle advanced work and actual fieldwork, the products you create will be useful to send with your application so that the admissions committee sees your actual work abilities. As graduate school admissions get more competitive, research experience has become essential.</p>

<p><em>Attend or Present at a Conference…or Even Publish a Paper</em></p>
<p>Academic or professional conferences give you a sense of where the discipline is moving and a great opportunity to meet people or get exposure for your work.  Besides, having to speak in front of a professional audience is a great educational experience!  The AAA or NEAA are great for this. As graduate school admissions get more competitive, dissemination of research at a conference or even published form has become more important.</p>

<p><em>Expand Your Network</em></p>
<p>It’s also worth it to begin to <strong>expand your network</strong> and experiences in Anthropology before you graduate:</p>
<ul>
	<li>attend lectures and workshops at other regional schools, again to meet more people and get a sense of what’s going on in the discipline.</li>
	<li>take a job or research internship with an ongoing anthropological project or institution (i.e., an archaeology consulting firm, a development consulting firm, etc.) or become a research assistant to a professor.</li>
	<li>if possible, work with an established professional on one or more writing projects.</li>
</ul>
