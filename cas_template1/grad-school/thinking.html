<h3>What should I consider when thinking about graduate school in Anthropology?</h3>

<p><em>Should I even pursue an M.A. or Ph.D.?</em></p>
<p>Some Questions to ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do you have the interest to sustain you for a longer program or would you rather do a shorter one? (Average Ph.D. completion time is 8.5 years, while an M.A. generally takes between 1.5 and 3 years.)</li>
	<li>How will a graduate degree help get you the career you want?  Which degree is better for that career? Have you done some research to determine whether folks in that career path recommend an advanced degree?</li>
	<li>Is there funding available, or do you pay your own way? (usually M.A.s are difficult to fund, a PhD should not be undertaken without full or nearly full funding).</li>
	<li>Do you want to get an M.A. to see if you like it, and then consider a Ph.D.?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Other Options to Consider</em></p>
<p>Getting an M.A. degree in a discipline related to your anthropological interest, including regional studies disciplines, education, geology, etc. before getting a Ph.D. in Anthropology.</p>
<p>Talk to advisers, people in the field, etc. about the process of graduate school, job prospects, state of the discipline, etc. As with any major decision, it is <em>caveat emptor</em>. Know pretty well what you’re getting yourself into, and know the different career options ahead of time.</p>

<p><em>Who gets a PhD anyway?</em></p>
<p>Most get a Ph.D. because they have some questions they want to explore and want intellectual growth - <em>not because it’s the automatic stepping stone to a particular career</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Don't fool yourself: the academic job market has been pretty grim, and it's not going to improve anytime soon</em>.</strong> Anthropology grad school (especially at the PhD level) is not a ‘professional school’ in the same vein as an M.B.A., J.D. or M.D. (One possible exception would be Applied Anthropology, but even that is debatable since applied work is not always available in the fields in which you train).</p>
