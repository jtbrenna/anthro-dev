<h3>How Can I Pay for Graduate School?</h3>

<p><em>Funding, or Show Me the Money!</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Does the school offer scholarships or fellowships? Full support (tuition, stipend, health benefits) or partial? Is it for the duration, or only a couple of years?</li>
	<li>Will you be required to teach (and how does that affect the amount of time to degree – it usually slows it down)?</li>
	<li>Will you have to get loans? How much? This is normal for an M.A, but you should not accept a PhD program offer without significant funding.</li>
	<li>$100,000 at a private university, <em>in tuition alone</em>! And remember: you also have to eat, clothe yourself and buy books! Be prepared for the fact that an M.A. could require a relatively heavy debt load (especially if it is a private university) – easily over $30,000.</li>
	<li>Do students have opportunities for summer funding?</li>
	<li>Do students get funding to do fieldwork and/or have employment prospects in the department?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You should consider applying for the following before you get to grad school to pay for it:</strong><br>
NSF, Jacob Javits Fellowship, Ford Foundation, Mellon, NIMH, federal Title VI programs, regional studies centers (i.e., African Studies Center), etc. [Recognize though that these are national competitions, so you have to have a pretty clear idea of what you are going to accomplish in graduate school as well as great GRE’s/grades.]<br><br>

<p><em>If you are willing to pay for grad school, especially a PhD (i.e., you are heir to a fortune), then make sure they know it; they may not accept you solely on the basis that they’ve already given their fellowships to other candidates (even though they want you too); so if you can pay for it, they might take you.  On the other hand, if you cannot pay for it, let them know directly in the financial aid statement of the application - this may influence them to offer you funding to ensure that you come there.  Be frank with them.  You can generally defer undergraduate loans if you are going to graduate school.</em></p>
