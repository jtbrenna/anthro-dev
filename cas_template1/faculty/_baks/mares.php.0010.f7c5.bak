        <p>Teresa  Mares is an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of Vermont  and is affiliated with the Transdisciplinary Research Initiative in Food  Systems. She received her B.A. (Summa Cum Laude) in Anthropology and Foreign  Languages and Literatures with a concentration in Spanish from Colorado State  University (2002), and her M.A. (2005) and Ph.D. (2010) in Sociocultural  Anthropology from the University of Washington. She also completed a graduate  certificate in Women Studies at the University of Washington. Prior to coming  to UVM, Dr. Mares was a Social and Behavioral Sciences Diversity Postdoctoral  Fellow in the Department of Anthropology at Ohio State University.</p>
        <p>Dr.  Mares&rsquo; research focuses on the intersection of food and migration studies, and  she is particularly interested in the ways that the di<a name="_GoBack"></a>ets  and foodways of Latino/a immigrants change as a result of migration. Her  dissertation<em>We Are Made of Our Food: Latino/a Immigration and the  Practices and Politics of Eating </em>investigated how the claims of Latino/a  immigrants to food justice and food entitlements are made, reshaped, and denied  in Seattle, Washington. Analytically, Dr. Mares engages with theories and  concepts of citizenship and transnationalism, identity and foodways, and  contemporary social movements. She is committed to applied, community-based  ethnographic methodologies and is currently developing a new project on food  access and food security among Latino/a dairy workers in Vermont.</p>
        <p>Recent  publications include a forthcoming article entitled &ldquo;Here We Have the Food Bank&rdquo;: Latino/a  Immigration and the Contradictions of Emergency Food&rdquo; in <em>Food and Foodways, </em>&ldquo;Tracing Immigrant Identity Through the Plate  and the Palate&rdquo;  in <em>Latino Studies, </em>Vol. 10.3 (2012), &ldquo;Mapping the Food Movement: Addressing  Inequality and Neoliberalism&rdquo; (co-written with Alison Alkon) in<em>Environment  and Society: Advances in Research</em>, Vol. 2 (2011); and a chapter entitled  &ldquo;Environmental and Food Justice: Toward Local, Slow, and Deep Food Systems&rdquo; (co-written  with Devon Pe&ntilde;a) in the edited volume<em>Cultivating Food Justice: Race,  Class, and Sustainability</em>(MIT Press 2011). During the 2012-2013  school year, Dr. Mares is teaching courses on Food, Culture, and Politics,  Cultural Anthropology, Ethnographic Field Methods, and The Anthropology of Food  and Gender.</p>
