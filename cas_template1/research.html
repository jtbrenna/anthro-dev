<p>The research conducted by <abbr>UVM</abbr> anthropology faculty is rather diverse and various students have been involved with faculty research in the recent past. See individual <a href="?Page=faculty.html&SM=facultysubmenu.html">faculty pages</a> as well as our blog feeds for <a href="?Page=faculty_research.php&SM=researchsubmenu.html">Faculty</a> and <a href="?Page=student_research.php&SM=researchsubmenu.html">Student</a> Research. Some recent anthropology research involving students has included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the study of prehistoric archaeological collections from the Caribbean island of Anguilla</li>

  <li>osteological analysis of human remains from South America</li>
