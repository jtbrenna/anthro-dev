<h3>Planning for Study Abroad</h3>

<h4>When to Go?</h4>
<p>As long as you have a minimum 2.5 cumulative GPA, sophomore status, and good social 
standing at the university, UVM will grant you permission to study abroad. Most 
students go during their third year. A handful go during their sophomore year, and others 
their senior year, but keep in mind that you must take 30 of your last 45 credit hours at 
UVM.</p>
<p>Some key courses in the major and/or minor are offered only during certain semesters 
(i.e., Theory and Linguistics in the fall, Social Org in the Spring). Plan out your major 
and/or minor in advance, and consider how study abroad will help fulfill those 
requirements.</p>

<h4>Seek Advising</h4>
<p>In order to study abroad, you must attend an information session and meet with a Study 
Abroad Advisor, both at the Office of International Education (OIE). You should also 
meet with your academic advisor as early in your planning as possible to discuss 
programs, the application process, and your plan for completing the major or minor.</p>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<p>Different programs have different prerequisites, which may include language and certain 
specialized coursework. Some programs also have minimum GPA requirements. We 
suggest that at a minimum, you should have completed Anthropology 21 before studying 
abroad.</p>
