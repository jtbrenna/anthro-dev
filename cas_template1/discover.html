<h3>Discover Anthropology</h3>

    <p>In the nineteenth century, American anthropology was organized into the four subfields we still know today—sociocultural anthropology, archaeology, physical/biological anthropology, and linguistic anthropology—in contrast to Europe’s focus on sociocultural anthropology. American anthropology strives to be holistic, a legacy championed by Franz Boas and his student Alfred Kroeber, who once described four-field anthropology as a “sacred bundle.” Over the decades, American anthropologists have fought hard to defend this four-field legacy, and as a result dozens of American universities have anthropology departments with each subfield represented, including UVM Anthropology.</p>

    	<li>It introduces students to the distinct areas of anthropological knowledge, which gives students an opportunity to follow a path that corresponds most closely to their interests.</li>
    	<li>Specialized research within the subfields benefits from a holistic grounding in the larger questions and concerns that interest the whole discipline.</li>
    	<li>In recent years, some cutting edge areas of research have emerged that cross subdisciplinary boundaries, such as biocultural research, ethnoarchaeology, etc.</li>
    	<li>Students benefit from conversations faculty from different subfields have with each other about common and divergent perspectives.</li>
