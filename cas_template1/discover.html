<h3>Discover Anthropology</h3>

    <p>In the nineteenth century, American anthropology was organized into the four subfields we still know today—sociocultural anthropology, archaeology, physical/biological anthropology, and linguistic anthropology—in contrast to Europe’s focus on sociocultural anthropology. American anthropology strives to be holistic, a legacy championed by Franz Boas and his student Alfred Kroeber, who once described four-field anthropology as a “sacred bundle.” Over the decades, American anthropologists have fought hard to defend this four-field legacy, and as a result dozens of American universities have anthropology departments with each subfield represented, including UVM Anthropology.</p>

    <p>Today, because of specialization, a small percentage of anthropologists actually work across the boundaries of subfields: one recent study observes that less than 10% of articles in the discipline’s flagship journal American Anthropologist combine subfields. Many respected anthropologists have also called for “unwrapping the sacred bundle.” Yet, here at UVM, we continue to emphasize the value of a four-field education at the undergraduate level for a number of reasons:</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>It introduces students to the distinct areas of anthropological knowledge, which gives students an opportunity to follow a path that corresponds most closely to their interests.</li>
    	<li>Specialized research within the subfields benefits from a holistic grounding in the larger questions and concerns that interest the whole discipline.</li>
    	<li>In recent years, some cutting edge areas of research have emerged that cross subdisciplinary boundaries, such as biocultural research, ethnoarchaeology, etc.</li>
    	<li>Students benefit from conversations faculty from different subfields have with each other about common and divergent perspectives.</li>
    </ul>
