<h4>Who is my advisor?</h4>
<p>You can find out by going to the Registrar's <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/registrar/">Homepage</a> and clicking on Banner for Students. You can also come by the department office (509 Williams Hall), and ask our Administrator, Cindy Longwell, for that information. If you have been working with or have specific interests that align with a particular faculty member, you can ask Cindy to assign you to that person as your advisor. If for whatever reason you need to change advisors, you can ask Cindy to help you.</p>
<p>While every effort is made to continue your advisor assignment from the moment you declare your major, it isn't always possible because of changes in faculty assignments (e.g. sabbatical leaves), changing program enrollments, and students changing from one program to another. So there are times when students must be reassigned.  If you are reassigned to a new advisor, keep in mind that this can be a great opportunity to get to know another Anthropology faculty member.

<h4>What is the best way to get in touch with my academic advisor?</h4>
<p>At the beginning of each semester, your advisor will send you a note indicating when s/he has office hours, or indicating a willingness to schedule appointments. The Anthropology Department office also posts office hour times. If you have a conflict in your schedule that prevents you from attending office hours, you should send an e-mail to your advisor or call the department office and ask the best way to schedule an appointment.</p>
<p>If you call and leave a voicemail or if you send an e-mail be sure to identify yourself, leave a clear message concerning your reason for the call and leave a clear statement about how you can be reached. If you leave a phone number or e-mail address be sure to speak very slowly and clearly. Many students contact their faculty advisor by e-mail. We urge you to be very clear about your questions/issues and if the issue is quite complex, simply use e-mail to schedule an appointment.</p>
