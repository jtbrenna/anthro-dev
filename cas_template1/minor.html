<h3>Minor in Anthropology</h3>
<div id="intro">
<h4>How should I plan out a minor in Anthropology?</h4>
<p>All students minoring in anthropology should carefully consult the minor worksheet:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~anthro/documents/anth_minor_worksheet_021213c.pdf">Downloadable minor planning worksheet</a>.</p>
<p>Anthropology minors must take at least two of the four introductory Anthropology core courses (21, 24, 26, 28) and four more courses at the 100-level or above. You should choose the two core courses for your minor based on your interests within anthropology, since these courses are prerequisites for 100 and 200 level courses in the same subfield. For example, if you are interested in taking more advanced archaeology courses and courses on a particular area of the world, you might choose ANTH 24 (Prehistoric Archaeology) and ANTH 21 (Cultural Anthropology). </p>

<p><em>Eighteen (18) hours in anthropology, including the following:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em> </em>6 hours from the following introductory core courses:&nbsp; ANTH 21, 24, 26, or 28.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Of the 12 additional hours, at least 9 hours must be at the 100-level or above. </li>

We strongly encourage you to attend to meet with an anthropology faculty member to help plan your course load based on your interests in anthropology.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p><strong><u>Anthropology Minor Requirement Checklist</u></strong></p>
