<p>The Anthropology Department considers study abroad to be an integral aspect of a high quality 
undergraduate education in all subfields of anthropology. Study abroad provides you with the 
opportunity to move from learning about the world to learning in the world. With the right program and 
frame of mind, you can gain invaluable cross-cultural and field research experiences that will enhance 
your studies, career prospects, and outlook on life.
