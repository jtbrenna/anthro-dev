<div id="intro">
<p>Anthropology students at <abbr>UVM</abbr> are provided with opportunities to work with different faculty and others beyond <abbr>UVM</abbr> to gain &quot;hands-on&quot; experience in the field. Often referred to at <abbr>UVM</abbr> as the APLE program, the Academic Programs for Learning and Engagement, these opportunities are briefly explored below under two categories:</p>
</div>
<h4>Research</h4>
<p>The research conducted by <abbr>UVM</abbr> anthropology faculty is rather diverse and various students have been involved with faculty research in the recent past. Recent anthropology research involving students has included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the study of prehistoric archaeological collections from the Caribbean islands of Anguilla and Montserrat</li>
  <li>study of  archaeological collections from Maine and Vermont</li>
  <li>osteological analysis of human remains from both Bolivia and Vermont</li>
</ul>
<p>These and other research opportunities are ongoing for anthropology students. Generally, research opportunities are available to advanced students in the different subdisciplines of anthropology. </p>
<p><strong>How do you get involved? </strong>Students should <a href="/~anthro/?Page=faculty/faculty.php">contact individual faculty members </a>with whom they are interested in doing research and/or contact the department chair.</p>
<h4>Internships</h4>
<p>Internship opportunities for <abbr>UVM</abbr> anthropology students are potentially even more diverse than faculty research collaboration opportunities, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li> internships through <abbr>UVM</abbr>, for example, work with the <abbr>UVM</abbr> Consulting Archaeology Program doing a gamut of field and/or laboratory activities</li>
  <li>internships external to <abbr>UVM</abbr> such as one student's recent work with the Vermont State Archaeologist, Vermont Division for Historic Preservation, in Montpelier</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other potential opportunities for internships, depending on the student's background and interest in anthropology, although these too are generally done by advanced students. </p>
<p><strong>How do you get involved? </strong>Students should <a href="/~anthro/?Page=faculty/faculty.php">contact individual faculty members</a> or talk to your advisor. <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~career/?Page=internships.html&amp;SM=otherjobsubmenu.html"><abbr>UVM</abbr>'s Career Center</a> also maintains a working knowledge of internships available outside of <abbr>UVM</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Study Abroad</h4>
<p>The department considers study abroad to be an integral aspect of a high quality undergraduate experience. Learn about planning and prerequisites in our <a href="?Page=guides.html&amp;SM=advisingmenu.html">advising section</a>. </p>
