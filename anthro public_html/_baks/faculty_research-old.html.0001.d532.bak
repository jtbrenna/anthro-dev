<p>People often cannot believe how encompassing a field anthropology is, and how much it <em>matters</em> to very current issues. That is, until they read about some of the current research being done by our faculty members. </p>

<h4>Visual culture and the environment</h4>
<p>Luis Vivanco's new area of research involves research on how the media, zoos, and other public institutions help shape popular understanding of environmental issues. Studying the cultural and political aspects of &quot;saving nature&quot; is not new to Vivanco, whose scholarship has focused on it for some time, mostly in Costa Rica and Mexico. <a href="/~anthro/?Page=faculty/vivanco.php">Read more about his education, courses taught, and publications.</a></p>
<h4>Body culture, road cycling, and trans-national sporting tradition and business</h4>
<p>Brian Gilley's new area of research has found him investigating the ways cyclists manage their bodies and the ways specific forms of bodily movement are endorsed by the cycle sports industry. This work is a change of pace for Gilley, whose original research in HIV/AIDS among Native American communities (causality, stigma and alientation) resulted in his recent book, &quot;Becoming Two Spirit,&quot; which documents the ways two-spirit (gay) Native American males challenge their alienation from mainstream native and tribal society. <a href="/~anthro/?Page=faculty/gilley.php">Learn more about Brian Gilley.</a></p>
<h4>Health and nutrition, diversity, identity, colonization and migration in the ancient Tiwanaku society of the Andes</h4>
<p>Deborah Blom's  recent pursuits in mesoamerica have led to publications and conference papers on human sacrifice, mortuary ritual, population movement, health and diet, social complexity, trade, and human body modification as a means of expressing identity. Blom specializes in archaeology and biological anthropology. <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~anthro/?Page=blomanth.html&amp;SM=facultysubmenu.html">Learn more about Blom's research and find links to her <abbr>C.V.</abbr> and personal website.</a></p>
