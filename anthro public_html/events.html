<em>&quot;Groundwater-Supported Settlement in the Deserts of Protohistoric Southeast Arabia&quot;</em> - talked by 
Jason T. Herrmann, 
Postdoctoral Fellow, <br>
Neukom Institute for Computational Science 
and 
Department of Anthropology, 
Dartmouth College. 
Human-environment interactions in marginal ecological zones are a topic   of equal relevance in the study of both contemporary societies and the   ancient past. In southeast Arabia, the decline of humid conditions   experienced during the Neolithic Period (c. 8000- 4200 BC) is   traditionally understood to have pushed human activity and occupation   out of the deserts toward the coasts and mountain wadis. Yet a few sites   from arid periods are found in the desert dunes. How did human activity   continue in this harsh environment after the rains ended?   Investigations at Saruq al-Hadid, a multi-period site in remote sand   dunes of the United Arab Emirates, have helped to answer this question   and establish a model for changing desert occupation strategies in   prehistoric Arabia. A combination of ground-penetrating radar (GPR)   survey and test excavations show that the site was once a resource-rich   oasis exploited by a series of distinct, adaptive occupations stretching   from the third millennium BC into the Christian era. A regional   analysis of modern land surface temperature, as recorded by the Moderate   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra satellite,   have positioned Saruq al-Hadid along a chain of oases fed by shallow   groundwater that is recharged by weather systems in the mountains far   from the oasis zone and would have breached the ground surface during   periods of elevated Persian Gulf sea levels. These findings contribute   to a finer-grained reconstruction of environmental change and provide a   framework for further exploration of archaeological sites and   environmental proxy data in the deserts of southeast Arabia that could   be extended to arid regions worldwide.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday, March 25</strong>, 6:00-7:15 p.m., 511 Williams Hall - 
<em>&quot;The 'Virtual Archaeologist:' using spatial simulation to connect behavioral models with data in arid Australia&quot;</em> - talk by 
Ben Davies, 
Ph.D. candidate, University of Auckland. 
The archaeological record of Australia&rsquo;s arid regions is dominated by   surface scatters of stone artifacts. Surface deposits have been   notoriously difficult to interpret due to the mixing of artifacts from   multiple time periods on to a common surface, with the outcome being a   time-averaged palimpsest. Understanding this kind of record requires   explanatory frameworks which reflect not only the processes generating   the samples we obtain from the surface record, but populations of   artifacts and features from which samples are drawn and the mechanisms   used to sample them. Drawing from modeling research in ecology, this   study uses spatial simulation methods to not only model the effects of   differential place use and visibility on the dispersal of stone   artifacts and heat-retainer hearths in a surface setting, but also the   process of conducting an archaeological survey. The manufacture of   artifacts is modeled using both experimental data and geometric   approximations. The transport, and discard of stone artifacts and the   construction of carbon-bearing hearths follow existing models of place   use and distributions of resources. The roles of erosion and surface   visibility are explicitly considered. Simulations are then placed within   a specific context in Western New South Wales, Australia. The outcomes   from different patterns of modeled place use are presented, and spatial   samples are compared to corresponding samples from the archaeological   record. Through simulation exercises such as this, archaeologists can   evaluate assumptions upon which our interpretations are built and gain a   better appreciation for the behavioral and formational processes which   influence the character of the record. </p>
