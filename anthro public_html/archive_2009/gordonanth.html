  <p align="left">Born and raised in the most sparsely populated country in the world,  the former South West Africa (now Namibia), Rob went to boarding school  in South Africa and then on to the Afrikaans-language University of  Stellenbosch where he suffered the indignity of studying law, not  common law but African law, Roman-Dutch law and Roman law. Fortunately,  however, anthropology kept him sane; and after completing a Masters (on  "Gossip"), he decided, for a variety of reasons, to broaden his  horizons and received his Ph.D. at the University of Illinois. His  dissertation was based on his experiences while employed as a personnel  officer on a Namibian mine. Doctorate in hand he was extremely fortunate to be hired as a  lecturer at the University of Papua New Guinea where, determined to do  public service anthropology, he focused on issues which communities  defined as important. This led to research on the ongoing problems of  warfare in the Highlands. Three years later he was hired by the  University of Vermont and still enjoys this beautiful place and  wonderful colleagues. He typically teaches courses on Africa;  development; colonialism; law, war and disorder; as well as  introductory courses. </p>
  <p align="left">  Committed to a scholarly, rigorous, engaged anthropology focused  on problems which poor and victimized people define as important, his  work has largely been concerned with the "Bushmen" (or San or  ju-hoansi). This mode of research has led to a number of advocacy-based  publications labeled as "revisionist" because they challenge  theoretical orthodoxies. In trying to challenge the myth of the happy  and pristine hunter-gatherer aka "The Bushmen," he has been forced to  develop an interest in the role of the mass media, in particular the  role of visual imagery in sustaining and underwriting the way we think  about "primitive people." This has led to a current interest in visual  anthropology. </p>
  <p align="left">  His interest is not, however, restricted to those labeled  "Bushmen." On the contrary, he has also secured large grants to study a  diversity of problems ranging from the impact of soil erosion on land  tenure, to the implosion of health care services due to TB, to how  soccer players might be utilized to develop public awareness about  AIDS. That early schooling in law has also become a convenient  grounding for his work on legal systems, human rights, violence and  genocide. He has also served as a consultant to a variety of  non-governmental organizations ranging from the United Nations  Development Program to village level "grassroots" associations in  Africa. Public interest anthropology, that is where local people ask  him to do research on their behalf, is his vocation. </p>
  <p align="left">  His research has been sponsored by a variety of sources including  the University of Vermont, the Social Sciences Research Council, the  National Endowment for the Humanities, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the  Maryknolls and he has twice been awarded a Fulbright Fellowship. He has  also held visiting or guest positions at Rhodes University, the  University of Cape Town, the National University of Lesotho and the  University of Namibia. He is currently a Research Associate at the  Free State University in South Africa.</p>
  <p align="left">    Rob's work has appeared in English, German and French. Among his  books are <em>Mines, Migrants and Masters</em>, <em>Law and Order in the New Guinea  Highlands</em> (with Mervyn Meggitt), <em>The Bushman Myth</em>, <em>Picturing Bushmen</em>,  <em>The Meanings of Inheritance</em>, as well as several edited volumes. In  addition, his articles have appeared in a wide variety of places,  ranging from prestigious academic journals to the <em>National Geographic</em> to local newspapers. He has about a 150 publications to  his name and was named Uiversity of Vermont Scholar in 2007-08.</p>
  <p align="left">    Currently he is working on a number of projects, including a film  project on civil courage during the Second World War, an  anthropological history of dogs and colonialism in Africa and trying to  theorize and study the practice of inheritance as well as starting  field work on a number of projects in Germany. </p>
  <p align="left">    Despite all these activities, he still finds time to run (over 59 marathons), kayak and hike. <br>
