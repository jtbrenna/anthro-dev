<h3>Advising</h3>
<div id="intro">
<p>Any student who decides to major in anthropology should see the department chairperson, who, in consultation with the student and the department's administrative assistant, will assign an advisor from the department faculty. </p>
</div>
<h4>What does an advisor do?</h4>
<p>Think of an  advisor as your academic liaison. An advisor is meant to be an approachable faculty member, one who is also skilled in your chosen area of expertise, and who can enhance the student's relationship with the university.</p>
<p>Registration at <abbr>UVM</abbr> is done electronically, but advisors can be helpful in selecting courses, as well as explaining the organization and policies of the College and ensuring that you have fulfilled all the requirements you need to graduate.</p>
