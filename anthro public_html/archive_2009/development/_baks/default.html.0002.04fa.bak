<h3 id="homepage_head">Anthropology at UVM: A firm grounding in all four areas of the discipline</h3>

<div id="intro">
 <p>Although our faculty is deeply committed to research and other scholarly activities, we see our primary mission as providing a first-rate undergraduate education. Our majors are well-prepared  in the areas of archaeology, biological anthropology, sociocultural anthropology and linguistic anthropology. Many have even gone on to graduate work in anthropology and have shared feedback that this firm grounding in all four areas of the discipline has helped them succeed. bbbbbb</p>
