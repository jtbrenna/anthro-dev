<p>Emily Manetta, Assistant Professor of Anthropology, received her B.A.  from Swarthmore College in Philadelphia and her Ph.D. from the  University of California, Santa Cruz in Linguistics. Her current work  focuses the syntax of South Asian languages. Her dissertation, based on  linguistic field work with a Kashmiri refugee community, featured a  comparative analysis of the syntax of questions in Kashmiri and  Hindi-Urdu. Dr. Manetta has a strong secondary research interest in the  sociolinguistics and syntax of non-standard varieties of English, in  particular in her native Appalachia. <br>
  <br>
Dr. Manetta will be involved in the continuing development of  linguistics courses at UVM, teaching Introduction to Syntax, Language  and Mind, and Linguistic Anthropology. </p>
