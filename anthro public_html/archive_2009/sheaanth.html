<P align="left">As a sociocultural anthropologist who specializes in medical and
psychological anthropology, Chinese culture, and the geographic areas
of North America and China, Prof. Jeanne Shea's research interests
revolve around gender issues, health and healing, human development
and aging, and the lifecycle and intergenerational issues. She is
interested in cultural and generational differences in experiences of
the lifecycle, human development, and aging, in the types of health
concerns and social issues that mark lifecourse transitions, and in
the influences of gender, class, ethnicity, culture, and generation
on experiences of health, illness, healing, and the health care
system. In the broadest sense, she is concerned with issues related
to cultural processes, ethnic identity, socioeconomic class, economic
development, and social change. </P></CENTER>
<P>Prof. Shea's life history began with a childhood in northern
  Vermont and a yearning to learn about foreign languages and cultures.
  She went on to earn a B.A. in Asian Studies from Dartmouth College in
  1989, followed by an M.A. and then a Ph.D. in Anthropology from
  Harvard University in 1994 and 1998. Between 1986 and the present,
  over the course of six trips, she has spent three cumulative years
  living, studying, and doing research in the People's Republic of
  China. Her research in China has included field work on menopause and
  aging among Chinese women living in Beijing and investigation of
  contemporary issues surrounding romance, sex, and marriage in later
  life in mainland China. She has been an Assistant Professor at the
  University of Vermont since 1998, at which time she began a new
  research project on the Chinese community in Montreal, Quebec. At the
  University of Vermont, Prof. Shea works with a wide variety of
  departments and programs, including the Anthropology Department, the
  Area and International Studies Program, the Asian Studies Program,
  the Canadian Studies Program, the ALANA US Ethnic Studies Program,
  the Women's Studies Program, the Center for the Study of the Aging,
  and the Graduate College.</P>
