<P>&nbsp;<B>ANTHROPOLOGY CLUB</B></P></CENTER>

<P>Although it has a faculty advisor, the Anthropology Club is a
student-run organization providing a diversity of activities
revolving around various anthropological activities. Every year, for
example, the club visits the Longhouse at the Kahnawake Tribal
Territory to learn about traditional Mohawk life, eat native foods
and try out native dances. There are other field trips such as to the
Museum of Civilization in Ottawa. Club members give papers and
symposia at conferences such as the Northeastern Anthropological
Association meetings held every spring. Students from the club are
also active in the Fleming Museum's Family Days where they construct
Egyptian pyramids and Polynesian war canoes out of cardboard, make
African dolls out of clay and tell stories of ancient times. One
highlight of the year is the ethnic dinner where students make ethnic
foods and everyone samples the exotic results. The club also sponsors
film festivals and lectures. The Anthropology Club meets every
Thursday at 7:00 p.m. in the fifth floor lounge of Williams Hall. All
are welcome!</P>
