<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Anthropology students at UVM are provided
opportunities to work with different faculty and others beyond UVM to
gain "hands-on" experience in the field. These opportunities are
briefly explored below under two categories, Research and
Internships.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>RESEARCH:</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The research conducted by UVM anthropology
faculty is rather diverse and various students have been involved
with faculty research in the recent past. Recent anthropology
research involving students has included the study of prehistoric
archaeological collections from the Caribbean islands of Anguilla and
Montserrat, along with archaeological collections from Maine and
Vermont, for example. Other recent anthropology students have been
involved in osteological analysis of human remains from both Bolivia
and Vermont. These and other research opportunities are ongoing for
anthropology students. Generally, research opportunities are
available to advanced students in the different subdisciplines of
anthropology. Students should contact individual faculty members with
whom they are interested in doing research and/or contact the
department chair.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>INTERNSHIPS:</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Internship opportunities for UVM
anthropology students are potentially even more diverse than faculty
research collaboration opportunities, including internships through
UVM and beyond UVM as well. Potential internships at UVM include work
with the UVM Consulting Archaeology Program doing a gamut of field
and/or laboratory activities, for example. Recent anthropology
internships beyond UVM have included work with the Vermont State
Archaeologist, Vermont Division for Historic Preservation, in
Montpelier, for example. There are many other potential opportunities
for internships, depending on the student's background and interest
in anthropology, although these too are generally done by advanced
students. Interested students should contact Luis Vivanco, who serves
as the Internship Coordinator for the Department of
Anthropology.</FONT></P>
