<CENTER><B><I>MAJOR REQUIREMENTS IN ANTHROPOLOGY</I></B></CENTER>

<P>&nbsp;You must do thirty (30) hours of course work in
anthropology. There are five (5) required courses or course options,
along with five (5) other elective courses, for our major. We
recommend that the following four (4) required courses be taken first
during the freshman or sophomore years:&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Human Cultures (21)</LI>
   
   <LI>Prehistoric Archaeology (24)</LI>
   
   <LI>Physical Anthropology (26) and</LI>
   
   <LI>Linguistic Anthropology (28)</LI>
</UL>

<P>We suggest that one of the following two required courses be taken
during the junior year (you must take one or the other):</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Anthropological Theory (225) or Social Organization (228)</LI>
</UL>

<P>Each major must take at least five (5) additional advanced (100-
or 200-level) courses, of which only one may be an independent study
and at least one must be at the 200-level.</P>

<P>A total of 45 anthropology credits are allowable out of a required
minimum of 122 credits for a B.A at UVM.</P>

<P>Any student who decides to major in anthropology should see the
department chairperson who, in consultation with the student and the
department's administrative assistant, will assign an advisor from
the department faculty. Registering at UVM is done electronically,
but advisors can be helpful in selecting courses, explaining the
organization and policies of the College and ensuring that you have
fulfilled all the requirements you need to graduate.</P>
