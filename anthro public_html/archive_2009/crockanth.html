  <p align="left">Before returning to the University of Vermont as a faculty member,
John G. Crock, attended UVM as an undergraduate in the mid 1980s. 
After graduating from UVM, John returned to his home state of Maine
to work for the University of Maine, supervising archaeological field
work throughout Maine and Vermont.</p>

<P>In the early 90s, good fortune and an interest in islands (he grew
up in Bar Harbor on Mount Desert Island) led John to the Caribbean to
conduct archaeological research on the islands of Montserrat and
later Anguilla.  Following this experience, John entered graduate
school at the University of Pittsburgh.  His dissertation research
focused on late prehistoric Amerindian society in Anguilla and the
development of socially complex chiefdoms in the northern Lesser
Antilles.  John lived in Anguilla from 1995-98 conducting field work
and received his Ph.D. in 2000, the same year he returned to Vermont
to direct the Anthropology Department's Consulting Archaeology
Program (<A HREF="http://www.uvm.edu/~uvmcap"><strong>UVM CAP</strong></A>).   John
keeps busy as the UVM CAP Director, overseeing numerous
archaeological studies conducted across Vermont every year.  He
brings his extensive field experience into his Prehistoric
Archaeology class, typically taught in the spring semester.  John
continues to be active in Caribbean archaeology as well, presenting
papers at international conferences and co-instructing UVM's field
school in Anguilla with Jim Petersen.  John has authored dozens of
technical reports for consulting archaeology projects and also has
published articles on his research in New England and the
Caribbean.</P>
