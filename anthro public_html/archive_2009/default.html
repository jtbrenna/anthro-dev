</CENTER>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Anthropology and UVM have roots going back
to the early days of the discipline. One of the first, if not the
first, undergraduate course in anthropology in the United States was
taught here in 1886 by a geologist, and subsequent Dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences, George Henry Perkins. Anthropology at
UVM became a separate department in 1971 and moved to its present
location on the top floor of Williams Hall with its striking views of
Lake Champlain and the Adirondacks. Although the faculty of the
department is deeply committed to research and other scholarly
activities, we see our primary mission as providing a first-rate
undergraduate education. Many of our majors have gone on to graduate
work in anthropology and have told us they appreciate the firm
grounding in all four areas of the discipline they have received. We
strive to prepare students in the areas of archaeology, biological
anthropology, sociocultural anthropology and linguistic anthropology. In addition to
the <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~anthro/?Page=majoranth.html&SM=ugsubmenu.html">major</a>, we also have a <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~anthro/?Page=minoranth.html&SM=ugsubmenu.html">minor</a> in  anthropology. The minor emphasizes developing an understanding of at least two of the four subfields. We also feel a
strong obligation to provide students who are not concentrating in
anthropology with a sense of the discipline and especially some idea
of the diversity of human kind. We are especially committed to providing
students with a comprehension of the variations in human populations
and a sensitivity to cultural differences. In order to implement
these concerns, we offer a variety of courses in all four subfields. Our advising program, including the Teacher Advisor Program (TAP) of first-year seminars, emphasizes individual attention and a mentoring relationship between faculty and students. &nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><font color="#000000">Over the past ten years, the department offerings have become increasingly popular with UVM students. The department has added many new faculty who are contributing  new perspectives and research initiatives. All of our faculty are actively engaged in scholarship, guaranteeing that our course offerings reflect developments and trends in contemporary Anthropology.</font></P>

INFORMATION</I></B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~anthro/?Page=COURSE&category=ANTH&SM=coursessubmenu.html">department offers a broad range of courses</a> reflecting the breadth of the discipline as well as the
diversity of our <a href="facultyanth.html">faculty's experiences and research interests</a>. Our program
begins with four basic courses designed to introduce anthropology's
four major subfields - Human Cultures, Prehistoric Archaeology,
Biological Anthropology and Linguistic Anthropology. Students can gain practical field
experience in courses such as Field Work in Archaeology and Methods of
Ethnographic Field Work. Course offerings emphasize both cultures of different areas of the world, such as Middle East Ethnography, Chinese Culture, Anthropology of Eastern Europe, Cultures of Africa, Latinos in the U.S. and Peoples of South Asia. Faculty also regularly teach topical classes related to their ongoing research. Recent offerings include  Law, War and Disorder; Anthropology of Media; Culture, Health and Healing; Primates and Anthropology; HIV/AIDS in Cross-Cultural Context; Street Children; Tourism and Heritage; Language, Gender and Sexuality;  Archaeology of the American Southwest; Language and Mind; and Archaeology of Frauds, Myths and Mysteries. The UVM <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/academics/catalogue2007-08/?Page=courses/coursecatalogue.php&SM=coursemenu.html&category=ANTH">on-line catalogue</a> contains more specific information
on all these and other offerings. Internships or field work practicums  are also available on a course
or semester basis, typically for upper-level students.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We also have lab facilities where students
interested in archaeology, human osteology, and forensic anthropology
can find training and experience, including in class such as Human Osteology and Archaeology, Stone Tool Technologies and a yearly summer field school in archaeology. Students may pursue their own
interests by enrolling in Readings and Research in which they may
work with an appropriate faculty member on their own
individually-designed research. Highly motivated students may elect
to do College Honors in which they prepare a major research project
under the supervision of a faculty member.</FONT></P>
