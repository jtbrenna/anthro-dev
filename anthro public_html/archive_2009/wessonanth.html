<p><a name="wesson"><strong>Cameron Wesson&nbsp;</strong></a>joined  the UVM faculty as Associate Professor and Chair of Anthropology. He  received a B.S. in architecture and a B.A. in anthropology from Auburn  University and completed his M.A. and Ph.D. at the University of  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He has held academic appointments at  Auburn University, the University of Oklahoma, and most recently at the  University of Illinois at Chicago.</p>
<p>Dr. Wesson's archaeological  research addresses the political economy of Native American societies  during the contact and colonial periods in the southeastern U.S., with  particular interest in the Muskogee Creek peoples. He is also concerned  with examining the role of Native American peoples in the cultural  dynamism of the post-contact period through the use of both  archaeological data and modern Creek informants. He has published three  books as well as a number of journal articles and book chapters on  these topics. His most recent volume,&nbsp;<em>Households and Hegemony: Early Creek Prestige Goods, Symbolic Capital and Social Power</em>, was released by the University of Nebraska Press in 2008. &nbsp;Dr. Wesson is presently working on a new book,&nbsp;<em>Poor White Trash: An Archaeology of Sharecropping and Tenant Farming</em>.</p>
