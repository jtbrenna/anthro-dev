  <p>MAJOR REQUIREMENTS IN ANTHROPOLOGY<br>
    (requirements for students entering UVM spring semester, 2007, or before) </p>
</CENTER>

<P>You must do thirty (30) hours of course work in
anthropology. There are five (5) required courses or course options,
along with five (5) other elective courses, for our major. We
recommend that the following four (4) required courses be taken first
during the freshman or sophomore years:&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Human Cultures (21),</LI>
   
   <LI>Prehistoric Archaeology (24),</LI>
   
   <LI>Biological  Anthropology (26), <strong>and</strong></LI>
   
   <LI>Linguistic Anthropology (28)</LI>
</UL>

<P>We suggest that one of the following three required courses be taken
during the senior year (you must take one of the three):</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Anthropological Theory (225) <strong>or</strong> Social Organization (228) <strong>or</strong> Archaeological Theory (Anth 210) </LI>
</UL>

<P>Each major must take at least (5) additional courses. Four (4) of these must be advanced (100- or 200-level) courses, with at least one at the 200-level). </P>

<P>A total of 45 anthropology credits are allowable out of a required
minimum of 122 credits for a B.A at UVM.</P>

<P>Any student who decides to major in anthropology should see the
department chairperson who, in consultation with the student and the
department's administrative assistant, will assign an advisor from
the department faculty. Registering at UVM is done electronically,
but advisors can be helpful in selecting courses, explaining the
organization and policies of the College and ensuring that you have
fulfilled all the requirements you need to graduate.</P>
