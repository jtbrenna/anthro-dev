  <p><strong></strong></p>
  <h3 align="left"><strong>I don't feel like reading this website, what are the basics? </strong></h3>
  <p align="left"><a href="http://www.uvm.edu/%7Esvankeur/SHAP/Fieldschool_flyer.pdf">Click here</a> to see our flyer.</p>
  <h3 align="left"><strong>How do I apply? How much will it cost?</strong></h3>
  <p align="left">The five-week UVM field school is a six-credit course offered through <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/%7Esummer/">Continuing Education (CE)</a> as Anthropology 200. Additional details on registration can be found on their website. </p>
  <p align="left">You must obtain instructor approval to enroll in this course by filling out an application form and submitting an unofficial (or official) transcript. <span class="style2">To apply, download and fill out the following application, and submit it to Dr. Van Keuren. </span></p>

  <p align="left">The approximate cost of the course is: </p>
  <p align="left">Vermont resident&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $2214 <em>plus course fee </em></p>
  <p align="left">Out-of-state student &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $5586 <em>plus course fee </em></p>
  <p align="left">There are limited scholarships available to Anthropology majors, which will be distributed based on financial need and academic standing. We expect to grant two awards of no more than $1000. Further details will be posted in March. </p>
  <h3 align="left"><strong>When does the field school begin and end?</strong></h3>
  <p align="left">The field school begins on June 30. All enrolled students must arrive <em>no later </em> than the evening of Sunday, June 29. The final workday is August 1; students are free to depart beginning the morning of August 2. We will work Monday through Friday and weekends are generally free (see <strong>What's our schedule?</strong>). </p>
  <h3 align="left"><strong>How do I get to the field school?</strong></h3>
  <p align="left">Field school students are responsible for providing their own transportation via car or air to the project area. The most convenient airport is Phoenix Sky Harbor airport (PHX), which is a 3 &frac12; hour drive from the project area. <a href="http://www.wmlines.com/">White Mountain Passenger Lines</a> provides shuttle service from the Phoenix airport to towns in our project area. Our field school staff will pick you up when you arrive. Once you are at the field school, we'll provide all transportation in project vehicles. </p>
  <h3 align="left"><strong>Where will I live? What will I eat?</strong></h3>
  <h3 align="left"><strong>Housing </strong></h3>
  <p align="left">All field school students and staff will reside in a shared, lodge-style housing unit. Single or private rooms will not be available and you will likely be paired with two to three other students to a room. Beds will be provided but students will be required to bring bedding materials and towels. Staff and students will take weekly trips to public laundromats and retail stores in Show Low, Arizona. Students will have regular access to project computers to check email. Further details will be available in April when housing reservations are finalized. </p>
  <h3 align="left"><strong>Meals </strong></h3>
  <p align="left">Your meals are covered by the Anthropology 200 course fee. A staff cook will serve breakfast and dinner Monday through Saturday. We will take bag lunches that you prepare at breakfast to the site every day. All students and staff will assist the cook with cleaning duties, rotating through a schedule through the duration of the field school. Students will have very limited access to kitchen facilities and will not be able to prepare their own hot meals with the exception of Sundays. </p>
  <h3 align="left"><strong>What are we researching? What's our schedule?</strong></h3>
  <p align="left">You will be working at Fourmile Ruin, the largest Ancestral Pueblo (aka &quot;Anasazi&quot;) village in the area. The site was occupied during the Pueblo IV period (AD 1300 to 1400). It is located within just north of the Mogollon Rim, near the modern towns of Snowflake and Taylor. It was one of the key villages where groups came together in the fourteenth century and began to make a new, highly-symbolic type of pottery. The village was briefly excavated by Jesse Walter Fewkes in 1896 but has gone largely gone unstudied since. Our field school excavations at Fourmile Ruin are part of a long-term project that examines Ancestral Pueblo community reorganization during the late prehistoric period. The research is supported by grants from the National Science Foundation and the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. You can read more about the research on our project webpage, <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/%7Esvankeur/SHAP/SHAP_main.htm">Shumway Archaeological Project.</a></p>
  <p align="left">We will work Monday through Friday. We'll leave for the site at approximately 7 a.m. and leave at 2:30 p.m. Once back in camp, everyone will help clean and process artifacts until no later than 3:30. Aside from occasional field trips your weekends are open. There are copious opportunities for mountain biking, hiking, fishing, and other recreational activities in the region. Check the <a href="http://www.arizonaguide.com/">Arizona tourism webpage </a> for more information. </p>
  <h3 align="left"><strong>What's the area like?</strong></h3>
  <p align="left">This portion of east-central Arizona is at the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Our project sites range in elevation from 6000 to 6500 feet above sea level. Fourmile Ruin is located in a grassland and sage landscape, just north of a vast Ponderosa Pine forest along the Mogollon Rim. Much of the latter is part of the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/asnf/">Sitgreaves National Forest. </a>Although we will be in a high-elevation area, temperatures and weather can be intense and occasionally unpredictable. July marks the beginning of the rainy season (or the &quot;<a href="http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/psr/general/monsoon/">monsoon </a> season&quot;) in the Mogollon Rim area, which is marked by thunderstorms and intense, brief rainfall. However, it is not unusual to have very hot, cloudless days. To give you an idea of the possible extremes, the records for July in Taylor, Arizona, are a high of 104 and a low of 27. </p>
  <p align="left">The project area is in the vicinity of the towns of <a href="http://ci.show-low.az.us/">Show Low</a> and <a href="http://www.pinetoplakesidechamber.com/">Pinetop-Lakeside.</a>. There is a <a href="http://www.nrmc.org/">regional medical center</a> in Show Low. </p>
  <h3 align="left"><strong>Who will I work with?</strong></h3>
  <p align="left">You and eight to nine other students will work with Dr. Van Keuren and four field assistants. Students will work in crews of two to three during excavation. You will also rotate our of excavation crews to receive training in site survey and other essential field skills. </p>
  <p align="left">Dr. Van Keuren has been working in the region since 1994. His work began with excavations at Bailey Ruin as a graduate student with the <a href="http://web.arizona.edu/%7Escarp/index.htm">Silver Creek Archaeological Research Project</a> (SCARP), and continued recently with post-graduate work at Pinedale and Shumway ruins. This is the first summer of excavations at Fourmile Ruin. </p>
  <h3 align="left"><strong>How will I be evaluated? </strong></h3>
  <p align="left">All students will be graded on their participation in a wide range of activities, including field and lab work, lectures and occasional workshops, and fieldtrips. The major portion of the grade will be based on the final write-up of excavations. Additional details will be available in the information packet that is distributed to enrolled students. </p>
  <h3 align="left"><strong>I still have questions!</strong></h3>
  <p align="left">Feel free to email <a href="mailto:svankeur@uvm.edu">Dr. Van Keuren</a> with questions or concerns. All field school students who are enrolled and accepted to the field school will receive detailed information packets in May. All field school students will be required to attend a short planning meeting in early May. </p>
