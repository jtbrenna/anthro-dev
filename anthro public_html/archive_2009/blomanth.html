  After spending her childhood in Mattoon, Illinois, Deborah Blom
  began her college career in biomedical engineering at Northwestern
  University. However, discovering anthropology later in college, she
  ultimately received her B.S. in Anthropology from the University of
  Houston (1990) and her M.A. (1992) and Ph.D. (1999) in Anthropology
  from the University of Chicago. She joined the Anthropology faculty
at the University of Vermont in 1998.</P>
<P>Blom has undertaken field work in Mesoamerica, Andean South
America, and the U.S. She specializes in archaeology and biological
anthropology and is interested in the study of human skeletal remains
in archaeological contexts. While residing in the state of Vermont,
Blom has also been active in reporting on human burials from Native
and European American cemeteries that have been disturbed through
construction or slated for repatriation. Building on her interests,
Blom has taught several courses at UVM and elsewhere, including
Introduction to Prehistoric Archaeology, Archaeological Theory,
Laboratory Methods in Biological Anthropology, Introduction to
Physical Anthropology, Origins and Evolution of Human Culture,
Peoples of South America, Funerary Archaeology and Bioarchaeology,
Advanced Human Evolution, Nonhuman Primate Social Behavior, Life,
Death, and the Human Body, and Human Osteology.</P>

<P>Currently, Blom focuses her research in South American Andean
regions of Peru and Bolivia, addressing question of health and
nutrition, diversity, identity, colonization, and migration within
ancient Tiwanaku society, as well as earlier and later developments.
Her research has been funded by The H. John Heinz III Fund,
Vanderbilt University&#146;s Discovery Grant Program, the University
of Vermont&#146;s Committee on Research and Scholarship and College
of Arts and Sciences Deans Fund, the Wenner Gren Foundation for
Anthropological Research, the Tinker Foundation, and the William and
Flora Hewlett Foundation. These pursuits have led to publications and
conference papers on human sacrifice, mortuary ritual, population
movement, health and diet, social complexity, trade, and human body
modification as a means of expressing identity. A complete list of
these activities can be found in Blom&#146;s <A HREF="http://www.uvm.edu/~dblom/DBlomCV.html"><strong>curriculum
vitae</strong></A>.</P>
