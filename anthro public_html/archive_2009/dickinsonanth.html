          Jennifer A. Dickinson is an Associate Professor of Anthropology at
          the University of Vermont.&nbsp; She received her A.B. in
          Anthropology and Russian from Bryn Mawr College in 1992, and two
          M.A.'s, one in Anthropology, and another in Russian and East European
          Studies from the University of Michigan (1995;1996).&nbsp; She
          received her Ph.D. in Anthropology from the University of Michigan in
          1999.&nbsp; She has done research in several regions of the former
          Soviet Union, and currently focuses on Eastern Europe, and in
          particular, Ukraine.&nbsp; Her broad academic interests cover many
          areas of cultural and linguistic anthropology, including
          storytelling, conversational pragmatics, language ideologies, the
          anthropology of Eastern Europe, and the anthropology of
work.</FONT></P>

Dickinson's dissertation, entitled "Life on the Edge:&nbsp;
Understanding Social Change through Everyday Conversation in a
Ukrainian Border Community," combined these broad interests,
exploring the ways in which everyday conversational interactions
among members of a dialect-speaking border community contributed to
these villagers emerging understandings of social and economic change
in post-Soviet Ukraine.&nbsp; Her dissertation also contributes to
studies of contemporary rural Ukraine, and to linguistic study of the
Slavic varieties spoken in the Zakarpattja (Transcarpathian) region
of Ukraine.&nbsp; One of the main foci of her dissertation, and of
her continuing work in linguistic and cultural anthropology, is the
nature of conversational storytelling, from the level of grammatical
structure to the nature of topic shift and the role of storytelling
in creating social cohesion and social meaning.</FONT></span></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Dr.
Dickinson has recently begun a new project that reflects her
interests in linguistic anthropology, anthropology of post-socialism,
and the anthropology of work.&nbsp; In the summer of 2000, she
returned to the Lviv and Zakarpattja regions of Western Ukraine to
interview people who sell goods in various city, village, and
regional markets.&nbsp; The ethnographic and linguistic materials she
collected promise to yield rich data on the transformation of
work-based identities and developing notions of a "new" market
profession.&nbsp; In December of 2001, she participated in a larger
project on post-Soviet censuses by observing and reporting on the
conduct of the first Ukrainian national census in the Zakarpattja
region.&nbsp; Her latest research project, continuing in summer 2003,
concerns images of Ukraine and its transition to the market economy
in contemporary advertising.&nbsp;</FONT></span></P>
