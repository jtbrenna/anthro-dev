Petersen </p><p align="center">Associate Professor and Chair </p><p align="center">Department of Anthropology </p><p align="center">1954-2005 </p><p align="center">Presented by John Crock </p><p align="center">Assistant Professor of Anthropology </p><p align="center">Director, Consulting Archaeology Program </p><p align="center">September 12, 2005 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James B.  Petersen, Chair of the Department of Anthropology, was murdered on August 13,  2005, while conducting research in the Amazon. &nbsp; Without provocation,  he was shot while he and colleagues were robbed at a family restaurant in Iranduba,  Brazil. &nbsp; At the time of his death, Jim was co-directing the Central Amazon  Project, a groundbreaking archaeological study of the past societies that once  thrived at the heart of the world's greatest river. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jim was  born in Bristol, Connecticut, in 1954. &nbsp; He graduated from Plainville  High School in 1972 as class president and valedictorian. &nbsp; After studying  at Middlebury College (1972-73) and taking time off to explore the country,  Jim enrolled at UVM, majoring in anthropology. &nbsp; He graduated from UVM  in 1979, Phi Beta Kappa. &nbsp; Soon thereafter, Jim entered the Ph.D. program  in Anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh. &nbsp; He earned his doctorate  in less than three years, a departmental record. &nbsp; His dissertation, the  first ever on archaeology in Vermont, is on the Winooski site, a large, multi-period  Native American village site located less than a mile from campus. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1983,  after Jim finished graduate school, he moved to Maine and soon thereafter accepted  a position at the University of Maine at Farmington (UMF) where he founded  the UMF Archaeology Research Center. &nbsp; Jim served there as associate professor  and Director of the Archaeology Research Center until 1997. &nbsp; During his  fifteen years in Maine, Jim rewrote the prehistory of the state. &nbsp; He  led large scale archaeological surveys of interior rivers and lakes and directed  intensive excavations of nationally significant sites. &nbsp; </p><p>During his time in Maine, Jim never stopped conducting research in Vermont  and also expanded his research interests well beyond New England. &nbsp; He  taught his first of eleven biannual UVM field schools in archaeology here in  Vermont in 1983. &nbsp; The field school, a month-long, hands-on course, was  the hands down favorite of his students and one of his greatest legacies. &nbsp; Each  field school he taught produced at least one graduate who later became a professional  archaeologist. &nbsp; He was a profoundly influential teacher who never stopped  teaching and always had time for his students young and old, currently enrolled  or long since graduated. &nbsp; </p><p>In 1997, Jim gave up tenure at the University of Maine at Farmington and took  a pay cut to accept a full-time assistant professor position at his beloved  alma mater. &nbsp; Moving back to Vermont with his wife, Jennifer Brennan,  and teaching at UVM fulfilled a lifelong dream. &nbsp; Jim quickly achieved  the rank of associate professor while also serving as interim director of the  Consulting Archaeology Program. &nbsp; In 2001, Jim was elected the Department  Chair, a job he regularly admitted was not his favorite. &nbsp; Even more than  a promotion to full professor, Jim looked forward to next Spring ('06) when  he would step down as Chair and be able to devote more time to his own research. </p><p>If only he had more time. &nbsp; Jim was a top notch scholar who devoured  the work of others with the same appetite he had for his own research. &nbsp; His  incredible capacity for work, his unequalled command of the literature and  his own field work experience made him a leading authority in the archaeology  of three major culture areas including northeastern North America, the Caribbean  and lowland South America. &nbsp; At the time of his death, he had active projects  in four different countries with a long list of collaborators. </p><p>In addition to being an impeccable field scientist, Jim was a dedicated laboratory  archaeologist devoted to the thorough study of human material culture. &nbsp; His  meticulous study of Amerindian technologies, including stone tools, ceramics,  and perishable textiles, led to ground breaking insights into past social interaction  and ethnicity. &nbsp; </p><p>Jim was also thoroughly committed to publishing the results of his work. &nbsp; His  impressive record includes some seven monographs and edited volumes, 58 peer-reviewed  articles and chapters, and hundreds of other articles, chapters and technical  reports. &nbsp; The volume of his published work is even more impressive considering  his shortened career and how much of his precious free time he gave to others  as a mentor, advisor, and colleague. </p><p>Over the last three decades, Jim analyzed hundreds of thousands of artifacts,  all the time focused not on the objects themselves but what they could tell  us about people. &nbsp; He was, at the core, a people person. &nbsp; This made  him a fantastic anthropologist, as comfortable conversing with living people  of all walks of life as he was using a shovel and trowel to uncover the past  of others. </p><p>The University and the world have lost a gifted teacher, a legendary researcher,  a great friend, and a generous and gentle man. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
