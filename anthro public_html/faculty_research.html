<h3>Faculty Research</h3>
<p class="intro">People often cannot believe how encompassing a field anthropology is, and how much it <em>matters</em> to very current issues. That is, until they read about some of the current research being done by our faculty members. Below we offer a few highlights, however <a href="/~anthro/?Page=faculty/faculty.php">all faculty members are conducting research; details available in each faculty member's profile.</a></p>
<div id="small_leftcolumn">
  <h5>Visual culture and the environment</h5>
<p>Luis Vivanco's new area of research involves research on how the media, zoos, and other public institutions help shape popular understanding of environmental issues. Studying the cultural and political aspects of &quot;saving nature&quot; is not new to Vivanco, whose scholarship has focused on it for some time, mostly in Costa Rica and Mexico. <a href="/~anthro/?Page=faculty/vivanco.php">Read more about his education, courses taught, and publications.</a></p>
<h5>Health and nutrition, diversity, identity, colonization and migration in the ancient Tiwanaku society of the Andes</h5>
<p>Deborah Blom's  recent pursuits in mesoamerica have led to publications and conference papers on human sacrifice, mortuary ritual, population movement, health and diet, social complexity, trade, and human body modification as a means of expressing identity. Blom specializes in archaeology and biological anthropology. <a href="?Page=faculty/blom.php">Learn more about Blom's research and find links to her <abbr>C.V.</abbr> and personal website.</a></p>
