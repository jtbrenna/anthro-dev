<P><FONT FACE="Courier New">Each major must take at least five (5)
additional advanced (100- or 200-level) courses, of which only one
may be an independent study and at least one must be at the
200-level.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New">A total of 45 anthropology credits are
allowable out of a required minimum of 122 credits for a B.A at
UVM.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New">Any student who decides to major in
anthropology should see the department chairperson who, in
consultation with the student and the department's administrative
assistant, will assign an advisor from the department faculty.
Registering at UVM is done electronically, but advisors can be
helpful in selecting courses, explaining the organization and
policies of the College and ensuring that you have fulfilled all the
requirements you need to graduate.</FONT></P>
