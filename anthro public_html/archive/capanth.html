<P><FONT FACE="Courier New">The Consulting Archaeology Program (CAP)
provides another opportunity for students to gain experience in
hands-on archaeology and employment opportunities. CAP's primary
function is to assist state and federal agencies, as well as private
developers in their environmental review process, a requirement for
any federally-funded and licensed projects. The role of CAP is to
identify, evaluate and develop management plans for prehistoric and
historic sites that may be affected by various types of construction
such as highways, hydroelectric facilities and housing
developments.</FONT></P>
