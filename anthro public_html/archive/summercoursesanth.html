have been fascinated while watching the behavior of apes and monkeys.
They are so much like us, yet in many ways different. They have been
studied to help us gain insight into our species, what it means to be
human, and as a foundation for interpreting the origins of humans and
their behavior. In addition, they are simply interesting in their own
right. In this class we will discuss the behavior and appearance of
nonhuman primates, in such arenas as their responses to their
environments, social factors, diet, reproduction, social
interactions, and ethics. Through this we will also shed more light
on humans and the ways that we respond to our environments." The
class will include many visuals, discussion, studies on Vermonters as
primates, and lecture.</FONT></P>

places and organizations such as much the Abenaki Tribal Museum, and

To present a balanced view, we will invite a speaker from the Vermont

Vermont should not recognize the legitimacy of the Abenaki
community." Students will be evaluated by attendance, discussion
participation and final projects. This is a 6-credit
