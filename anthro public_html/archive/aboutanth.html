<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Anthropology and UVM have roots going back
to the early days of the discipline. One of the first, if not the
first, undergraduate course in anthropology in the United States was
taught here in 1886 by a geologist, and subsequent Dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences, George Henry Perkins. Anthropology at
UVM became a separate department in 1971 and moved to its present
location on the top floor of Williams Hall with its striking views of
Lake Champlain and the Adirondacks. Although the faculty of the
department is deeply committed to research and other scholarly
activities, we see our primary mission as providing a first-rate
undergraduate education. Many of our majors have gone on to graduate
work in anthropology and have told us they appreciate the firm
grounding in all four areas of the discipline they have received. We
strive to prepare students in the areas of archaeology, physical
anthropology, ethnology and linguistic anthropology. In addition to
the major, we also have three minors: social anthropology,
prehistoric archaeology and linguistic anthropology. We also feel a
strong obligation to provide students who are not concentrating in
anthropology with a sense of the discipline and especially some idea
of the diversity of human kind and an understanding of how and why
people act as they do. We are especially committed to providing
students with a comprehension of the variations in human populations
and a sensitivity to cultural differences. In order to implement
these concerns, we offer a variety of courses, many with low student
to professor ratios which allow us to give motivated students a high
level of individualized attention.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The department offers a broad range of
courses reflecting the breadth of the discipline as well as the
diversity of our faculty's experiences and interests. Our program
begins with four basic courses designed to introduce anthropology's
four major subfields - Human Cultures, Prehistoric Archaeology,
Physical Anthropology and Linguistic Anthropology. To aid students in
developing familiarity with specific geographical regions and
representative human groups, we offer a wide variety of "people"
courses such as North American Indians, Indians of the Northeast,
Native Peoples of Canada, Cultures of South America, Cultures of
Africa, and South Pacific Cultures.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We also offer a number of topical courses
that focus on special themes such as Women, Society and Culture;
Crisis Cults and Movements; Urban Anthropology; Third World
Development; Race and Ethnicity; Sociolinguistics; Aging in
Cross-Cultural Perspective; Historical Archaeology; Anthropological
Theory; Archaeological Theory; Social Organization; Museum
Anthropology; and Culture Change. Students can gain practical field
experience in courses such as Field Work in Archaeology, Methods of
Ethnographic Field Work, Microethnography and the student-initiated
Senior Seminar. The UVM catalogue contains more specific information
on all these offerings. Internships or field work practicums such as
the one in the Diabetes Prevention Program in the Kahnawake Tribal
Territory outside of Montreal, Quebec, are also available on a course
or semester basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We also have lab facilities where students
interested in archaeology, human osteology, and forensic anthropology
can find training and experience. Students may pursue their own
interests by enrolling in Readings and Research in which they may
work with an appropriate faculty member on their own
individually-designed research. Highly motivated students may elect
to do College Honors in which they prepare a major research project
under the supervision of a faculty member.</FONT></P>
