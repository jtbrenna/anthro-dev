        <p> Dr. Jonah          Steinberg is a cultural anthropologist of the Indian          Subcontinent and its diasporas, with a special focus on          society's most marginal members, from India's street children to          Europe's Roma (Gypsies). He received his BA from Swarthmore          College and his MA and PhD from the University of Pennsylvania,          and he has been a member of the UVM Anthropology faculty since          2006. His book,&nbsp;<em>Isma'ili Modern:</em>          <em>Globalization and Identity in a Muslim Community</em>, was published by the University of          North Carolina Press in 2011. Based on his doctoral research in          Pakistan and Tajikistan, the book deals with the dynamics of          Himalayan villagers' membership and participation in the          transnational Isma'ili Muslim community. Dr. Steinberg's current          research, funded by a multi-year grant from the National Science          Foundation, explores the lives of runaway children in North          India, and investigates the intersection of poverty, domestic          crisis, and cultural models of childhood in their home contexts.          Dr. Steinberg's courses at the University of Vermont deal with a          variety of themes, including globalization, social crisis, human          migration, religious revivalism, the peoples of South Asia,          Islamic cultures, anthropological writing, and street children. </p>
